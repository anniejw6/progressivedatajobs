Thread engages underperforming high school students confronting significant barriers outside of the classroom by providing each one with a family of committed volunteers and increased access to community resources. We foster students’ academic advancement and personal growth into self-motivated, resilient, and responsible citizens.

The Salesforce Database Manager (DM) is the primary administrator of Thread’s Salesforce database which includes data on over 400 students, over 1000 volunteers, and thousands of collaborators and prospective volunteers. Our database is a key piece of infrastructure as we scale up to 3000 volunteers and 1000 students in the next three years. As a highly data-motivated organization, staff is held accountable to over 250 metrics - the DM oversees the backend to ensure these metrics are easily accessible and employees have the tools they need to achieve them. The DM ensures that our data systems are scalable and sustainable for all organization processes - including, but not limited to, volunteer recruitment, volunteer management, student growth, fundraising and resource recruitment, and staff management.

The DM will work closely with the head of the data and evaluation team to determine appropriate solutions to defined business needs in data collection, process management, and metric reporting. This DM is the primary Salesforce administrator for our organization, and will be responsible for systems administration and integration, customization, configuration, automation, implementation, testing, and documentation. DM will play a key role in implementing technical solutions to improve and replace legacy systems and tools as Thread doubles the size of its network in the next year.
