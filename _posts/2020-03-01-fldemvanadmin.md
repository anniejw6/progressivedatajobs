The Florida Democratic Party is expanding our data and analytics team in advance of 2020 and are currently seeking a VAN Administrator. As a VAN Administrator, you will work with volunteer data teams, campaigns, county parties and elected officials to administer the FDP VAN. Day to day responsibilities include responding to help tickets, working with stakeholders to monitor data quality, and training users on best practices. This is an entry level data position, perfect for a candidate who wants to hone their skills and become a data and analytics expert by learning in a fast-paced environment in the largest swing state in the US in advance of the 2020 Presidential elections.

At the Florida Democratic Party the data department's core competency is to solve problems that involve data and information. As part of this core competency, we administer the VAN (our CRM) in partnership with county parties and campaigns. We create reports to support the work that staff and volunteers are doing throughout the state of Florida. Our team is responsible for targeting, using maps and statistical analysis to ensure we are speaking to the voters who most need to hear from us, that we are tracking progress to goals across all departments and ultimately that we are using data and analytics to ensure Democrats win

While a broad skill set is always a plus, what we are really looking for is someone who can specialize and take ownership over a few aspects of our departmental work. So whether you are an experienced campaign staffer who is new to data, or a technical guru who is new to campaigns, or something in between, we want to hear from you. If you are interested in politics and want to join a team that is all about problem solving, we hope you will apply.


Salary: $40,000 to $48,000
