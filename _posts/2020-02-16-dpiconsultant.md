In the last four years, two of the biggest innovations in progressive organizing and politics have come from research with base-building organizing groups: randomized controlled trials conducted by the Analyst Institute, which showed that relational organizing had the highest
impact of any other program intervention on voter turnout, and Race-Class Narrative, which documented effective ways to build multi-racial governing constituencies. However, organizers
and researchers lack venues in which to do more of this kind of systematic research using the membership data that organizations collect on a daily basis.

With funding from the Rockefeller Family Fund, the Ford Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and 2020 Vision Ventures, the Democracy, Power, and Innovation Learning
Community will bring approximately 45 practitioners (directors, lead organizers, and data directors) from fifteen base-building organizations together to learn from each other and
strategize collectively about how to improve the craft of organizing. As part of this learning cohort, DPI partner organizations will build more robust internal tracking systems to collect
individual membership data (name, address, phone, demographic data, recruitment information) and individual membership activity (names and dates of participation in organizational events,
such as one-to-ones, trainings, house meetings, actions, voter contact activities, or other events).

We seek two part-time data consultants to help collect, systematize, analyze, and visualize, and make sense of this data in ways that generate insights about—and feed back to improve—DPI partner organizations’ strategy. Our work together is grounded in mutual respect, learning, and relationship between all parties involved—organizers, data staff, directors, funders, consultants, and the like.


Desired skillset
* Data manipulation: Ability to export, clean, and merge membership microdata from various organizational repositories and CRM platforms (e.g., EveryAction, VAN, PowerBase, Google spreadsheets)
* Data interpretation: Ability to analyze the data to identify patterns and opportunities for organizational growth
* Data visualization: Ability to synthesize quantitative findings in charts, graphs, or other visuals that tell a story about the underlying data
* Familiarity with (or interest in and respect for) community or political organizing and civic engagement
* Training and presentation skills to disseminate findings to organizational leaders, data directors, funders, and other stakeholders
* Coaching and relational skills to help grassroots partner staff and volunteers enter and analyze their organizing data


Commitment and compensation
DPI seeks two analysts to be contracted on a monthly retainer to start work immediately. The exact hours and scope of services would be determined in consultation with the DPI leadership team. The expected pay for the project would be in the range of $6-10,000 per month, depending on the exact scope of work, background, and experience of the consultants selected (approximately 20 hours of work/week). Work can be remote but the consultant(s) are expected to attend three in-person convenings (locations TBD) in late March, May, and August 2020.
To apply, please send your CV and a brief cover letter that includes two data visualizations you produced to Liz McKenna (emckenna@jhu.edu). To contextualize the visualizations, please note 1) the toplines that an organizer or organizational leader might take away from looking at them and 2) what you see as the strategic implications of those takeaways for someone interested in improving their organization or program.


Salary: $6-10,000 per month
