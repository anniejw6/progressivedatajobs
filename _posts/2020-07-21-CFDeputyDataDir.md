About the Carolina Federation
The Carolina Federation is a statewide organization that brings local people together across race and
the rural-urban divide to build political and electoral power in their own communities and across North
Carolina. At a time when the right-wing holds power in our state and far too many campaigns overlook
the importance of long-term investment in local communities, we are developing a bold approach to
organizing and voter engagement for North Carolina. By unleashing the full potential of our diverse
communities we can create real change in the lives of our people, win elections that were previously
unwinnable and transform the political terrain. This approach to building power is defined by our
relentless commitment to bringing new people into political action, our deep investment in local
leadership, and our intentional integration of cultural work with community and electoral organizing.

Our Challenge
In 2020, we are faced with the challenge of supporting our local multi-racial chapters and affiliates to
grow their own leadership, political power and voting base, while also living through the dual
pandemics of viral contagion and racialized violence that have ongoing, devastating impacts on our
leaders' lives and their communities. And we must do so while also moving forward our plans for the
critical, large scale voter contact necessary to deliver key electoral victories needed to build the
long-term political and electoral power of our people.
Indeed, in this moment we are contesting not only for the immediate needs of our communities, but
also for the future of our state and the nation. North Carolina is a key battleground between the
right-wing neo-confederacy and our vision of multi-racial, progressive populism. Our ability to
demonstrate the power of transformative electoral organizing to move new people into action -- in the
face of overwhelming community crisis -- will be put squarely to the test this year.

About the Deputy Data Director Position
In this moment of growth and opportunity for the Carolina Federation, we are looking to hire a Deputy
Data Director to support the growing data management needs for our programmatic work across the
state.

We are seeking a Deputy Data Director who would
* be thrilled to help grow innovative political organizations across North Carolina
* fit our culture of courageous leadership and playful camaraderie, and
* share our deep love of people and ferocious commitment to power and transformation.

The Deputy Data Director will work directly with our Data and Digital Director, our statewide Field
Director and with the wider organizing staff of the Carolina Federation to support mutli-racial,
multi-issue grassroots political power in our state. While our work is deeply relational at its core, we
seek to utilize the most effective technical tools and tactics possible to build our membership base and
reach voters in our communities. The Deputy Data Director’s primary role is to support this continued
integration of our data-driven electoral work with our relational organizing work.

Specifically, the Deputy Data Director will:
* Support the overall data needs of the Carolina Federation including our 2020 field
program and our county-level affiliates / chapters.
* Manage voter file access for designated staff and members. This will be done in
collaboration with state-level data staff within the NC progressive infrastructure.
* Develop and lead data trainings for county-level affiliates / chapters and for aligned
statewide organizations, in collaboration with state-level data staff within the NC
progressive infrastructure.
* Providing close data support to the voter contact efforts of the Carolina Federation and
closely aligned organizations, including phone banking, texting, relational voter outreach
and other voter contact methods.
* Provide administrative support for county-level affiliates / chapters to manage and grow
their membership base, including member outreach (CRM, etc.) and integration of
member lists with the voter file.
* Field questions and provide VAN and data support to our twenty Carolina Federation
field staff, across four counties.
* Support Carolina Federation field program in data tasks including (but not limited to)
loading mass text and call lists, loading dialer scripts, and updating volunteer recruitment
lists.

What We’re Looking For In A Deputy Data Director
These are the types of skills, competencies and qualities that we’d be looking for in our Deputy Data
Director. We offer these as a broad outline; it is not necessary that applicants have experience in all
skills and competencies:

* A commitment to building power through elections, issue campaigns, and organizing, centered
around the leadership of working-class people and people of color.
* A commitment to interdependence -- bringing your best, relying on the strengths of others, the
knowledge that we are responsible for each other’s well-being.
* An attention to detail and timelines; an ability to execute complicated sequential steps with
rigor and precision, often on a tight deadline.
* Ability to clearly communicate (with patience and humility) data-related information to
audiences who may not have much data background.
* Experience with voter contact programs and experience in the use of data in candidate or
issue-based campaigns.
* Familiarity with online electoral / advocacy tools and constituent relationship management
(CRM) tools.
* Experience with spreadsheets and data manipulation.
* Experience leading skills trainings, meetings, town halls or other forums for member and
community engagement.
* Experience advising and managing volunteer leaders and / or staff, providing clear direction
and support that enables the success of others and builds their long-term commitment.
* Experience in a staff capacity on a data-driven, electoral campaign.
