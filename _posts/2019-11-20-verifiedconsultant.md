Verified Voting (www.verifiedvoting.org), founded by computer scientists in 2004, is a leading national not-for-profit, non-partisan organization whose mission is to strengthen democracy for all voters by promoting the responsible use of technology in elections.

The unprecedented events of the 2016 election cycle focused the nation’s attention once again on the machinery and infrastructure of democracy. As Robert Mueller declared, “There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our elections. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.” This unprecedented threat to our voting systems emphasizes the need for a national response to strengthen our electoral processes especially now as we approach the 2020 Presidential election.

Verified Voting, in partnership with the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, is conducting a research project to examine the impact of the types of voting equipment, polling place technologies on marginalized communities specifically previously designated states under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

The ideal candidate is detail-oriented, proficient in analyzing large volumes of public data, report writing, and possesses strong project and time management skills.
