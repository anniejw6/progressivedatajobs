This position will report to the Managing Director and will manage a team of engineers and data scientists. They will provide leadership, vision, and strategy as well as excellence in execution. The ideal candidate will have deep software development knowledge and experience collaborating with Product, UX, and non-technical roles. This position is part of Swing Left’s Leadership team.

About Swing Left
Swing Left is a national grassroots organization that took back the House in 2018 by building a national campaign for Democratic candidates in 84 Swing Districts in three big ways: recruiting and training an army of volunteers, raising funds from grassroots donors, and building cultural momentum for the midterms. For 2020, we’ll be bringing our “campaigns-in-waiting” model to swing Senate seats, defend the House, win the state-level races needed to ensure fair maps for 2021 redistricting—and, of course, the Presidency.
In 2018 we took back the House. Join us, and help take back all the Houses in 2020.
