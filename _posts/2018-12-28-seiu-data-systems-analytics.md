The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is a 2-million member labor union united by the belief in the dignity and worth of workers and the services they provide. We’re dedicated to winning a better future for workers and their families, and creating a more just and humane society.

To achieve our vision, we are committed to creating the next forms of worker organization, building a wider movement for justice, dismantling structural racism, and innovating across all of our work.

While excellent data work is taking place across the union, a comprehensive external review has determined that our current data systems and processes are disjointed, inflexible and outdated.

We believe a modern, integrated data system and staff operation is critical to our success as a union. We envision a system that can ingest and store member data from local unions, connect person-level data from multiple sources in a data staging environment, and develop key reports and analysis from an analytic data warehouse, all flexibly designed to change with the rapidly evolving field of data technology.

ABOUT THE ROLE

We are seeking a Director to lead the creation and operation of a new, well-resourced Data Systems and Analytics Department.  This new unit will bring together a talented group of staff currently working in different parts of the union, as well as new hires and outside contractors. We expect the department to include at least 15-20 staff members, including 12-15 by the end of the first year.  

In addition to developing and managing the integrated data system, this multi-team department will be responsible for data quality, reporting, technology, and providing regular data support to SEIU local unions, campaigns and departments.

Are you a collaborative team leader with the skills, experience and drive to lead a strong and inclusive department that will launch a new data system? Are you motivated to work for a campaign-driven organization committed to building power for workers and creating a more just society? If so, please read on!
