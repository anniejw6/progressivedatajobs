This is the moment for climate action. An unprecedented number of Americans are expressing deep concern about climate change, and women are exercising their political power like never before. Mothers Out Front is positioned to grow our diverse, mother-led climate movement into a force for the change we need to ensure a livable climate for all children. And we need you to make this happen.

We are a fully remote, dynamic social impact organization with ambitious expansion goals. As our Senior Database Administrator, you will be part of the development team, leading the creation of guidelines that inform everything from day-to-day data entry to big picture reporting. You will help us maximize our database functionality, create systems and tools that strategically harness constituent data, and develop systems for sharing donor/donation information effectively and seamlessly with our organizing, operations, and finance teams. You will prepare regular robust reports and analysis of giving trends, campaign success, and donor data.

This is an exciting opportunity for a strategic, organized, thoughtful administrator who is focused not just on capturing accurate data, but on figuring out what story that data tells and harnessing that knowledge to help grow our movement.  

About Mothers Out Front          

Mothers Out Front builds our power as mothers to ensure a livable climate for all children. We are building a diverse national movement of mothers, grandmothers, and caregivers dedicated to convincing elected officials and business leaders to work for a swift, complete, and just transition away from fossil fuels to clean and renewable energy. We know that mothers have an important role to play in the climate change movement, and, when it comes to protecting their children, mothers are an unstoppable force for change! Our goal is simple: to enable mothers to take active leadership in climate change work by providing the structure, training, and tools for them to work together on campaigns in their communities and at the statewide level. 

We work with and draw leadership from the frontline communities who are experiencing the worst effects of fossil fuels — from the dangers and challenges caused by extreme weather patterns to devastating health effects like asthma and other respiratory illnesses — with particular attention to low-income communities and communities of color. 

We are a member-led, national organization that is growing quickly. Founded in 2013, this year’s operating budget is $4.1m. We currently have staff working in eight states and are a fast growing organization with no plans of slowing down. 

As the Senior Database Administrator, you will develop and codify best practices to ensure that accurate, meaningful data is captured, analyzed, and shared in a timely and accurate manner. You should have a demonstrated history of data management, with a keen understanding of both CRM administration (Salesforce strongly preferred) and of non-profit fundraising best practices. A passion for helping others succeed -  ideally at a progressive social impact organization - is also critical.
