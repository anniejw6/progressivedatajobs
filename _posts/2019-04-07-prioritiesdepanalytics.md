Itching to use data science to defeat Donald Trump? Looking to develop cutting-edge methods to process and utilize digital analytics? Join Priorities USA as our Deputy Director of Analytics.

Priorities USA is committed to standing up Donald Trump in order to build an economy that provides real opportunity for all families to get ahead, and to protect the fundamental, democratic ideal of equality for all Americans – regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. To achieve those goals and win in 2020, Priorities relies on data at every step of the decision-making process.

We’re looking for an individual to help build and lead an in-house team of data scientists to support those decisions. This team will be responsible for identifying, processing and analyzing the full scope of political, digital and advertising data. As the head of this team, you will be responsible for making recommendations on research methodologies to the Director of Analytics, implementing those approaches, and providing strategic guidance to senior leadership.
