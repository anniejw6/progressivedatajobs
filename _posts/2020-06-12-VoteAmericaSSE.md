VoteAmerica is seeking a full-time Senior Software Engineer that can commit to a six month employment term to take a leading role in the development of Get Out The Vote web applications, primarily by architecting, developing, and deploying high-quality Python and React code to Amazon Web Services. The ideal candidate will have a passion for increasing voter participation, while being comfortable working collaboratively and swiftly on a small, all-remote engineering and product team. This position is an opportunity to develop new software products on tight deadlines to drive as many Americans as possible to the polls.

Role Responsibilities:
You’ll be working primarily with the Tech team under the direction of the Director of Technology, who has had nearly 15 years developing civic-focused technologies and web tools. 

Here’s what you’ll be working on:
* Expanding on full-stack applications using Python and React
* Writing clean and scalable Python and React code that can be publicly released
* Taking ownership of bugs and feature requests submitted by product and support teams
* Working in a solutions-oriented fashion with stakeholders across the organization
* Mentoring other developers, and assist in code review and troubleshooting of others’ code
* Participating in “on-call” rotations to respond to system outages
* Other tech and organizational projects as assigned. We’re working to increase voter turnout, not just write code.

You should meet the following minimum requirements:
* 5-7+ years of experience as a Software Engineer or similar role working on a user-facing web application
* An understanding of all parts of a full-stack web application. We currently use Django and React, and trust every engineer to jump in where needed
* Familiarity with Amazon Web Service and working in the AWS console 

Bonus points if you have:
* Experience with container-orchestration systems such as Kubernetes or Elastic Container Service
* Experience building civic participation tools
* Prior political, campaign, or organizing experience strongly preferred
* A passion for increasing civic participation during the 2020 election and beyond

Some of the benefits of working here:
* Outspoken, queer, female CEO
* Short commute. We all work from home and it is just the best. 
* Parent friendly policies. If you need to take 3-5pm off every day to get your kids from school and make after school snacks, we're totally cool with that. 
* Excellent medical coverage. Full health, dental, and vision for employees and generous employer subsidies for dependent children.
* Generous time off. Unlimited paid vacation with leadership approval.
* Retirement. We offer a 401(k) because we want you to retire one day.
* Highly competent, down to earth, and humble team.
* Awesome slack channels. #pets, #politics, and #random are our favs.

Salary: The salary range for the role of Senior Software Engineer is $110K - $120K for candidates based in SF, NYC or DC.  The salary range will be adjusted based on cost of living data for folks who live in less expensive regions.
