Background: 
The National Domestic Workers Alliance, organizes domestic workers in the United States for respect, recognition and labor standards. We work to guarantee labor protections for domestic workers by winning legislation at the state level, pushing for regulatory changes at the national level, through the International Labor Organization at the global level, and elevating domestic workers as key leaders in building a powerful movement for a more just economy and democracy. 

NDWA was founded in 2007 by 13 local domestic worker organizing projects around the country. By 2016, the alliance had grown to include 60 affiliate organizations and 3 chapters. In 2016, we launched our membership association in order to dramatically increase our scale, power and sustainability. While most of our core leaders are engaged as leaders in NDWA affiliate organizations and chapters, the vast majority of our members will be workers who we engage with remotely and online. 

Salary: $ 60,000-70,000
