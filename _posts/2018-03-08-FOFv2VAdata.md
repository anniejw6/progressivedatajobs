For Our Future – Virginia Data Manager
Progressive 501c(4) and Super PAC is seeking a Virginia Data Manager to help meet the day-to-day data needs of this progressive organization.
For Our Future aims to win elections and gain political power by engaging and mobilizing people and community-based organizations on progressive issues. Building off of our 2016 campaign in five
battleground states, FOF will continue its unique and now-proven model to build infrastructure and power for progressive issues and candidates in Virginia in 2017 and beyond. The model is to work with
and through community-based organizations and local activist networks, with a focus on direct voter contact and earned media. Our goal is to turn communicators into connectors, engage communities in
policy discussions, and turn out voters for progressive issues and Election Day victories.
For Our Future is a project of For Our Future Action Fund (“FOFAF”), a non-profit “social welfare”
organization, & For Our Future (“FOF”), a federally registered “independent expenditure” political action
committee that incorporates both issue advocacy and electoral programming, respectively.
