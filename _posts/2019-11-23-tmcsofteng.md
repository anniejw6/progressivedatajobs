Do you want to ensure that progressive organizations have access to the best possible data, technology and technical expertise? We know movement organizing and advocacy are more urgent than ever and organizations and activists cannot easily access the tools to scale their work. Organizations often face the issue of dealing with siloed datasets from their various programs and tools, making it difficult to truly measure and optimize their impact.

Launched in 2017, The Movement Cooperative was founded with the aim of addressing these structural challenges. Currently our membership stands at more than 40 groups, with more organizations slated to join in the coming months.

Position Description
Looking for something different than the “normal tech job”? Looking for a way to channel your software skills into improving the country’s political landscape? TMC is uniquely positioned in the progressive tech ecosystem to scale engineering innovation as we support many of the most exciting and impactful nationwide advocacy organizations.

As a software engineer at TMC, you will help progressive organizations across the country reach their goals by building tools to improve their use of data and third-party advocacy products. You’ll work closely with our support team to understand organizations’ technical needs and the shortcomings of existing tools, and in turn, you will design and build tools to fill those gaps.

Salary: $75,000 and $95,000
Location: Remote
