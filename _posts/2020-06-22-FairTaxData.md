Vote Yes for Fair Tax is a ballot initiative committee working to pass the Fair Tax constitutional amendment, which will be on the ballot in November 2020, by engaging Illinoisans throughout the state and educating our residents about the importance of creating a more-fair tax system. We are a diverse coalition of organizations directly working with and for communities and families across Illinois that believe the Fair Tax is a common-sense reform needed to fix Illinois’s finances, strengthen our communities, and prevent cuts to the vital programs and services that working families depend on.

Illinois’s constitution limits how Illinois can raise money, resulting in an overall state and local tax system that is among the most regressive in the nation. The Fair Tax constitutional amendment changes the state constitution to eliminate the requirement that Illinois tax income at a single rate, also known as a “flat tax.” This change in the constitution will allow us to modernize our tax code, including higher rates for higher incomes and lower rates for people with low and moderate incomes.
