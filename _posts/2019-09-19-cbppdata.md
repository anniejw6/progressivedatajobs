The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities advances public policies that reduce poverty and inequality, advance prosperity and racial equity, and break down barriers to economic opportunity through research, analysis, and advocacy. A key area of work is reforming state revenue systems in order to ensure adequate and stable revenues for public investments. This work is conducted largely in concert with members of the State Priorities Partnership, a network of state policy organizations that the Center coordinates.


The State Data and Campaigns Senior Manager helps develop strategic public education, advocacy, and engagement campaigns to build support for the enactment and implementation of sound fiscal policies at the state level, and to counter damaging policy proposals that would increase poverty and inequity. The Senior Manager will work with partners to improve data processes and provide regular technical assistance for advocacy and list-building campaigns. As a member of our Outreach and Campaigns team, they will work with our team of strategists, policy experts, and state partners to solve calculable puzzles and understand how to best utilize advocacy and technology tools.
