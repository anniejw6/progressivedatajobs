We're hiring for the Director of the Data, Analytics, and Infrastructure Department at the AFL-CIO. We're looking for someone who can balance two goals:
1) Support the essential work that the Department does for the Federation and its affiliates today.
2) Help guide the AFL-CIO's work with data, analytics, and technology into the future - especially with member contact and member engagement programs.

We encourage you to apply even if you feel that you don't meet all of the listed qualifications. Thanks!

Overview of Responsibilities:
The Director of the AFL-CIO Data, Analytics and Infrastructure Resource Department is responsible for leading the work of the entire department (a team of 20+ people) and representing the department internally and with external partners, including affiliate unions, state federations and central labor councils, partner organizations and allies.

Instead, you will focus on being a strong advocate for the AFL-CIO as well as building and developing long-term goals for the department.
We are looking for someone committed to building power for the labor movement through technology. We understand the importance that organizing and deep member engagement plays in making labor stronger and you should too. You should be able to navigate competing priorities from multiple partners, be committed to running a program based in an analytical and data grounded mindset, and have a background in data, analytics, digital, web development or other technical field. You should also be comfortable explaining complex ideas to non-technical people and be a skilled presenter.
The Data, Analytics & Infrastructure Resource Department's goal is to generate lasting power for the labor movement, by building the Federation's programmatic tools, web development, data systems, and analytics capacity.
