The Digital Data Director will have a unique opportunity to join a large, deeply-skilled, and innovative campaigns team within a rapidly growing, digitally-driven organization at the forefront of Black liberation and empowerment.


This role will be centered on data management within the digital advocacy campaigning environment -- with email program fundraising and growth being a primary focus. However, when capacity and needs warrant, this role will also assist with data management within the field/electoral environment, in collaboration with other data team members.


The right candidate will combine strong data skills with effective communication abilities to help build Color Of Changeâ€™s data-driven culture.


The Digital Data Director will be based in one of four Color Of Change offices (Washington DC, New York City, Oakland, or Los Angeles) and report to the National Data Director.


Salary: $105,000
