The Advocacy Institute was created to support the legislative advocacy of social justice and movement-building organizations in across New York State. In the last 5 years, weâ€™ve helped hundreds of organizers and advocates engage in more efficient and effective legislative advocacy. The Advocacy Institute is a high impact work-environment. We create and sustain this environment by engaging proactively in intentional and transparent discussions about identity, power, oppression, trust, capacity building, teamwork, and performance. Throughout, we ground ourselves in a commitment to feminist, multiracial leadership. 

The Software Developer drives the advancement of our tools and data engineering processes. The position is part of a team that builds and produces products to satisfy our internal, member and client needs, and requires someone with experience in effective product management and team communication.

Given that this is a small team, the position will manage and do work ranging from website updates, the addition of features to custom software and modification of third-party applications used by our team (e.g. Podio, Zapier, Piesync, Google Apps, etc). The Software Developer reports to the Executive Director and collaborates with consultants and agencies as needed.
