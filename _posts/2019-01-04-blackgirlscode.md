Launched in 2011, Black Girls CODE (BGC) is devoted to showing the world that black girls can code,
and do so much more. By reaching out to the community through workshops and after school
programs, Black Girls CODE introduces computer programming and technology to girls from
underrepresented communities in technology areas such as web design, robotics, gaming, mobile
app development and more. By cultivating the next generation of coders we hope to grow the
number of women of color in technology and give underrepresented girls a chance to become the
future leaders in technology and the masters of their technological worlds. We thrive on working in a
collaborative, fast-paced environment. We represent a diversity of backgrounds, a wealth of
experience and a lot of fun.
