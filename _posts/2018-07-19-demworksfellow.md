Democracy Works has openings for three fellowships
* Junior Technical Fellow, the Voting Information Project
* Outreach Fellow, the Voting Information Project
* Senior Technical Fellow, the Voting Information Project

At Democracy Works, we believe voting should fit the way we live. To that end, we build technology for both voters and election administrators that simplifies the process and ensures that no voter should ever have to miss an election.
The Voting Information Project (VIP) coordinates with state election offices to publish nationally-standardized information about where and how to vote—data that powers everything from Google’s polling place search to our own text message and email reminders to TurboVote users. The junior data fellows will work with the VIP team for the 2018 election cycle, assisting with collecting, parsing, and assessing a nation’s worth of election data.
