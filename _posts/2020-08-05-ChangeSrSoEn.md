When the story of the 2020 election is told, there will be a section about how American democracy was preserved with the help of insight and data; chapters will be devoted to polling innovations that helped thousands of candidates -- from the Democratic nominee for President, to municipal candidates and everyone in between -- use modern data science techniques to win.

You want to be at the center of that. You work on doing things better, and you thrive in an environment that prizes a commitment to impact and accuracy in a fast-paced campaign-like environment.

Change Research encourages and expects campaign season engineers to lead projects, manage major tasks, and contribute substantially and meaningfully every day.

We value a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other.  We invite people with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives to join our team. 

About the role:

Software engineers at Change Research build the tools to conduct rapid, accurate surveys for campaigns across the country. This includes automation to launch and collect survey respondents at a scale that is only possible with intelligent software. And it includes arming our team of analysts with the tools to understand political opinions through data.  

As a small and fast-growing company we use a combination of proprietary software and orchestration of third-party services; we prize speed and effectiveness as shipping a feature one day after the election is immensely less valuable. You will be seen as a technical leader among our team of five software engineers and data scientists.

This is an election-season position that is full time through November 30, 2020.

 

About you:

This role may be a good fit if you have:
* 5+ years experience shipping production code in Python. Having familiarity with our data infrastructure stack -- Redis, Google Could Services (DataFlow, BigQuery), Apache Beam, and MySQL -- and/or with Docker is a plus.
* Interest in politics, political data, or helping to strengthen the Democratic infrastructure
* The ability to balance competing goals: rapid, election-season code releases, and sustainable technology that survives campaign cycles.

 

About Us:
In 2017, Change Research figured out a new way to quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online. We use this technology to guide forward-thinking candidates and causes and create winning strategies with them. 

Change Research is innovating to solve critically important problems at the intersection of data, social science, and politics. And in doing this, we hope to make our democracy better.

Salary: $7500 - $12,500 monthly
