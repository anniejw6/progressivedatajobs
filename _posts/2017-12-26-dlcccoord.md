[Job description linked](http://www.dlcc.org/sites/dlccfullsite/files/DLCC%20-%20Data%20Coordinator_0.pdf).

Be a part of the team that will be instrumental to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) taking back our state legislatures and — by winning crucial redistricting fights — remaking the U.S. Congress to re-enfranchise millions of voters and end the GOP single party rule that’s paralyzing our government. 

Our task is no less than to teach a generation of voters about the central role their state legislatures play in their day-to-day lives, and in the shaping of the country.

The mission is to win Democratic majorities and build Democratic power in state legislatures.
