UNITE HERE is a labor union leading the fight to organize hundreds of thousands of low-wage workers in hospitality jobs throughout North America. Our 300,000-member union is at the forefront of battles for workers' rights, immigration reform, living wages, and quality jobs in many cities throughout North America. We are mostly women and people of color, hailing from all corners of the planet. Without a union, people who cook and clean for a living often live in poverty, but with UNITE HERE, housekeepers, cooks and servers fight for and win middle-class wages and top-notch healthcare, along with dignity and respect on the job.
