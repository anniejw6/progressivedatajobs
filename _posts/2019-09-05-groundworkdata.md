Launched in 2018, the Groundwork Collaborative is a mission-driven effort to advance an economic vision that delivers meaningful opportunity and prosperity for everyone. We work with economic policy experts, progressive movement leaders, and activists on the front lines of progressive causes in communities across the country to develop and advance a progressive economic worldview, collaborate and foster new ideas, and develop new pathways to share information, and to break down issue silos, support and amplify each other’s work, and show up for one another on critical economic issue campaigns.


The Data Analyst will be a member of Groundwork’s Policy and Research team and will engage in substantive quantitative research and analytical work to advance a coherent economic worldview within the broader progressive movement. The Data Analyst will work closely with other members of the policy and research team to conduct original research, analyze national economic data, provide internal data guidance, create data products, and provide technical assistance. The Data Analyst  will translate technical research into clear and compelling pieces to support work across all of Groundwork’s programs and campaigns
