ABOUT SURVEY 160

Survey 160 is a software product designed specifically to conduct surveys via text message (SMS) conversation. The technology bridges a gap emerging between telephone interview methods — which are increasing expensive on a cost-per-interview because of declining response rates — and online panel interview methods, which often struggle to reach particular audiences of interest. Such audiences may include small geographies, customer lists, or defined segments of the electorate.

Our customers include high-profile political campaigns at both the national and state level, advocacy organizations, and brands. We launched in 2018, based on research conducted with Harmony Labs in New York, and later contributed meaningfully to political/advocacy research efforts in 2018. The company began scaling in earnest in early 2019, having received support from New Media Ventures as well as Higher Ground Labs.

Salary: DC or NYC preferred, remote possible
