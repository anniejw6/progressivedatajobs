EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

This is a unique opportunity to shape the American political landscape in a meaningful way, simultaneously engaging passionate grassroots volunteers and contributing directly to ballot-box outcomes. As our first Executive Director, you’ll be empowered to lead the growth of Tech for Campaigns and drive our emergence as a central pillar of the Left’s strategy to win future elections. TFC operates like a startup—tech-focused, quick-moving, and nimble. Accordingly, you will have strategic and operational responsibility for all aspects of TFC and our staff as we evolve into a mature organization delivering on our long-term political and technical promise.
