Rapid Resist recruits crowds at a moments notice to persuade lawmakers that can make or break Trump's agenda. Next up, we ask those activists to run for office. Our partner LLC also supports folks running for office with a texting program. 

We've sent 5.6 million texts and recruited 88,367 activists in conservative areas on behalf of 298 local groups. We've recruited 1,270 candidates and run programs for 40 clients including the future AZ governor. 

We strongly encourage folks living in conservative areas, women, POC, and LGBTQ folks to apply.

# CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER

As we move into 2018 elections and grow our organization, we’re seeking a CTO to join our leadership team. Your role will involve helping set our strategic vision when it comes to managing tool implementations, leading volunteer engineers, and directing tech projects. We’re looking for someone who has a strong technical background; you might not need to get in the weeds of coding yourself, but you need to be able to understand/read code, write clear specs, and do the tasks of a product manager. But in many cases, if you don’t have a volunteer handy or budget, it may be quicker to do the coding yourself.

We’re a lean team that’s all about hustling and getting our hands dirty to move quickly. We’ve all touched organizing, politics, and government in different capacities and share a passion for fighting Trump’s agenda and helping empower activists and political candidates at the local level.

You don’t think of yourself as a primarily technical person and your default is to buy, not build. That means you actually spend time understanding products and looking at the Zapier integrations. You are able to both push forward long-term, complex projects at speed and problem solve when things break. You’re great at getting a team on the same page about how to use the tech you’ve chosen.

Your two main initial projects are 1) polishing a connection between a Google form our volunteers use and a private API for our texting app and 2) implementing a CRM, specifically Salesforce, most likely by managing a consultant and working with our COO to design our business processes.

Rapid Resist is based in Oakland, CA; prefer to be able to commute to the San Francisco/Oakland area once every two weeks.
