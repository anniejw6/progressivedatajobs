The Marketing Team is responsible for managing ActBlue’s brand and all external communications. At ActBlue, we are the public advocates for small-dollar donors. We are looking to hire a Data Analyst to join our Marketing Team and fill a specific role as an in-house data journalist, working to tell the story of grassroots donors. You should be curious about small-dollar donor giving patterns, figuring out how campaigns and organizations can encourage more small-dollar contributions, showing how donors can help build a better democracy, and how ActBlue’s tools have an impact on small-dollar giving. You’ll have several different audiences that you’ll need to keep in mind and build data stories for: journalists, campaign and organization professionals, political insiders, internal stakeholders, and small-dollar donors themselves.

We are looking for someone experienced in analyzing and exploring large datasets, and eager to share insights in clear and creative ways. You’ll have several different audiences that you’ll need to keep in mind and build data stories for: journalists, campaign and organization professionals, political insiders, internal stakeholders, and small-dollar donors themselves.

You should be extremely curious and independently driven, coming up with more questions than you can answer about small-dollar donors. The ideal candidate would also be quick to explore proprietary data and adept at seeking out external data sources to knit together compelling narratives. Responsibilities range from quick analytical dives for press requests to longer-term reporting and dashboard construction. The candidate should have a range of skills from data transformation and exploration to statistical testing to visualization.
