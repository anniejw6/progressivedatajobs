Change Research is building technology that makes public opinion polling fast, affordable, and accurate for forward-thinking candidates. We are looking for a product lead who will guide our product experience.

In this role, you will help Change Research craft a great product for:

* candidates and organizations interested in working with Change Research
* existing customers who want to dig into the results and use polling insights to win
* voters who take one of our online polls

You will be our first product manager, and there will be a lot on your plate!

* You’ll be outward-facing and speak to many candidates, campaign managers, and leaders of advocacy organizations about polling and Change Research.
* You’ll work with our internal team -- engineers, survey analysts, marketers -- to make sure everything fits together into a great product experience.
* You’ll question how things are done today and find a better way.
* You’ll write, you’ll dig into APIs, you’ll run SQL queries to understand our data, and you’ll no doubt sketch up a design or two.
* You’ll comfortably go back and forth between working with know-everything engineers and know-everything politicians (even though they both know everything, they know different things!).
* Through it all, you’ll listen, think, communicate and execute in a way that considers the company’s and customer’s process holistically. You are obsessed with quality, problem solving and creativity.

We are looking for candidates with product management experience, technical sophistication, and a strong interest in politics.
