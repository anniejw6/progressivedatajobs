At BlueLabs, we relish the opportunity to teach, collaborate with, and learn from each one of our fellows. Our fellowship program isn't like most typical DC intern experiences. We ask our fellows to become a part of the BlueLabs family, to work intensively on a wide variety of projects, to undertake their own research, and to help us become a stronger contributor to social good. Our BlueLabs/Howard University fellowship program is currently recruiting applicants for our technology/development team. As a fellow you will be assigned a mentor to help guide you through your time at BlueLabs and ensure you have the resources you need to be successful. We will hold frequent trainings to teach you the tools and skills you need to make meaningful contributions to the work we and our partners do. We will ask a lot of you, and in return we are confident you will leave with a greater understanding of how data, analytics, and technology are changing the world.

Our fellows come from a variety of backgrounds (undergraduate and graduate schools - with majors varying from computer science to politics; public health to classics), and have a wide-array of skills (data and analysis, technical languages, communications experience), but they all have a strong interest in social justice, politics, or advocacy.

Our fellows are paid, full- or part-time, and academic credit is also available.
