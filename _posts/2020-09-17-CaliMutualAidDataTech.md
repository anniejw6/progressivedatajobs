Overview:

The state of California is running an innovative public health and safety initiative featuring one-on-one phone communication with Californians at risk from COVID-19 and natural disasters. The project targets highly vulnerable individuals and communities that face disproportionate impact from the pandemic, wildfires and other disasters. These include people with low incomes, people of color, people for whom English is not their first language, older adults and those with other socioeconomic vulnerabilities. This initiative uses phone bank technology usually reserved for voter engagement to have meaningful conversations and to share urgently needed resources with Californians at risk. 

Both openings are fully remote (work from home), immediate and will run through the end of November, with the possibility of extension. The phone bank call week is Wednesdays through Sundays and applicants must be able to work during Pacific Time.
