About the Indivisible Project

We are a dynamic, non-profit organization seeking initial full-time hires to support our mission: resisting Trump’s agenda by empowering local activist groups to make their Members of Congress listen. Our work is premised on a simple idea: that Trump’s agenda doesn’t depend on Trump--but rather on whether individual Members of Congress resist. In short, we work to support the creative, local leaders driving the Indivisible Movement.

Following the election of Donald Trump, a group of two dozen former congressional staffers and progressive advocates drafted a document called “Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda.” What is the Indivisible Guide? It’s a toolkit on citizen power, a set of local, defensive advocacy strategies and tactics for resisting the Trump agenda. Thousands of local groups have now formed in nearly every congressional district in the country to put the the guide into action.
