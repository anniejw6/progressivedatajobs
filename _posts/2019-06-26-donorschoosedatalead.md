DonorsChoose.org engages the public in public schools by giving people a simple, accountable, and personal way to address educational inequity.
Since its launch in 2000, more than 3.7 million "citizen philanthropists" have donated to classroom projects on DonorsChoose.org, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 34 million students in public schools, overwhelmingly from low-income households. Along the way, the organization helped to pioneer the field of crowdfunding and is now making an impact beyond school supplies.

DonorsChoose.org is a technology non-profit that is serious about data. We are seeking a Data Analytics Lead who is eager to play both a key technical and leadership role on a results-oriented three-person team that delivers critical work for stakeholders across the organization. In this player-coach capacity, a typical week may involve writing a custom data transformation script, running a donor re-engagement analysis, and briefing the executive team on the data roadmap.

The Data Analytics Lead will report directly to our CTO, and will manage a Data Scientist and a Business Analyst, who are already on staff. Youâ€™ll own our data analytics stack, at the center of which sits a Redshift warehouse that houses and links all of our data sources, including transactional, event, customer service and CRM data. This data represents over 4 million classroom requests for 6 million classroom resources from nearly 1 million teachers.

Salary: competitive salary and benefits package that includes 100% employer paid health, dental, and vision coverage; a matching 401k plan (up to 5% of your salary); an annual professional development stipend; and 5 weeks paid vacation plus national holidays.
