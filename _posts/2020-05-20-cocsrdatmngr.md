As Color Of Change expands its staff significantly in 2020, we are undertaking a major expansion of our data, analytics, and engineering capabilities to turbocharge our campaigns for change. Our electoral campaigns, grassroots organizing, and culture change work is generating a flood of data, some of which we are currently using to inform our work. But we’re just scratching the surface -- so much more is possible. That’s why we are making major investments in our data operation to ensure more and more of our data can be analyzed, and then leveraged, to guide our strategic and tactical decisions.

This role organizes, presents, and explains data, including but not limited to:

* Census data
* Voter file data
* Volunteer activity data
* Event data
* Specialty data sets acquired on an ad hoc basis (example: coronavirus prevalence data)
 
Note: a separate role focuses on our digital transaction data -- email, web, social media
This role has a management and leadership component: the Senior Data Manager manages, coaches, and mentors the Organizing Data Manager (who fulfills many of the ongoing data requests and needs from the team). Internally, this role leads by promoting opportunities to use data-driven strategies across the organization.

Responsibilities:

* Work across departments to identify important data projects the team should invest time and staffing in; success means prioritizing * projects that can drive decision-making
* Develop frameworks for how we organize metrics and goals, and how they can best be displayed in ways that support decision-making, including easy-to-understand displays for progress-to-goals concepts for individuals and teams alike
* Work in collaboration with the Analytics Engineer (under the supervision of the National Data Analytics Director) to identify reporting needs, develop products (dashboards, reports, etc.), collect feedback, and iterate as needed, drawing on data streams created and maintained by Analytics Engineer
* Create tracking systems using spreadsheet software and other tools as needed
* Ensure continuity and quality of data between systems by building checks into the systems to catch flaws in the data
* Identify the strategic insights that the reporting is revealing
* Manage direct report(s) effectively
* Provide consistent support for state data directors and help to fill gaps when necessary
* Present data to senior leaders, and when the data supports it, advocate for program changes
* Facilitate feedback from internal consumers of data (eg: field and leadership teams) to identify needs and potential collaboration opportunities
* On a continuing basis, provide formal training and informal coaching to help make staff educated and powerful consumers of data products
* Continually identify, surface, and promote opportunities the organization has to make better data-driven decisions

The ideal candidate will have:

* A perspective on how racial and class disparity are apparent throughout data systems, and an eagerness to engage with the team to identify solutions
* Familiarity with SQL, including the ability to write complex joins
* Ability to effectively present, explain, convince, coach, and troubleshoot on data-driven decisions with a wide set of stakeholders
* A demonstrated track record of increasing adoption of data-driven decision-making within a team or organization
* Ability to effectively manage staff to reach desired outcomes
* Experience proactively identifying opportunities to innovate and executing on those ideas
* A background working in an electoral or advocacy campaign environment
* Commitment to the mission of Color Of Change: to help people respond effectively to injustice in the world around us, moving decision-makers in corporations and government to create a more human and less hostile world for Black people in America
* Familiarity with a scripting language like Python (or others like JavaScript, Ruby, etc) is not required but is a plus 

Our tech stack includes:

* Field tools like TargetSMART, NGP VAN, and EveryAction
* Digital tools like ThruText, ThruTalk, ActionKit, and Google / Facebook ads
* Data warehousing tools like Civis Platform
* Dashboard tools like Periscope and Tableau
* Prior experience with any of the systems commonly used in the progressive movement is helpful, but not required. We are strong believers that if you have the fundamental technical skills required above but lack domain experience, a hungry desire to learn is a compelling substitute. 

Salary: $82,000
