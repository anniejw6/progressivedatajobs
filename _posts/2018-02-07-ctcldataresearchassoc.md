Manage a short-term team of election fellows to hit our data collection goals in a fast-paced and intense period of time.

Other duties assigned by the Director of Civic Data.
The Research Associate will be joining a small distributed team, and will report to the Director of Civic Data.

Responsibilities

Desired Qualifications
A successful candidate for Research Associate will have a comprehensive understanding of our mission and demonstrate a proven track record of success. In addition, while no candidate will possess every quality, the successful candidate will possess many of the following qualifications and personal attributes:

Meticulous attention to detail. You are able to organize non-centralized, non-standard information into a coherent format.
Thrives in an intensive work culture. You are able to handle the pressure of needing to get results given the tight time constraints inherent in working with elections.
Strong sense of curiosity. You take delight in immersing yourself in the rabbit hole of civic data and in discovering new, fun facts and edge cases in our work. You are able to stay motivated to produce excellent results when the work gets tedious (as it sometimes will!).
Intermediate to Advanced Microsoft Excel skills. You have at least a basic understanding of formulas to manipulate text and execute lookups.
Strong people or project management. You have an intense determination to get results, persist when facing roadblocks, and have a deep commitment to learning and improvement. You’re able to quickly build trust, credibility, and goodwill and provide meaningful feedback.
About CTCL
CTCL is a non-partisan, non-profit that uses technology to improve the way local governments and communities interact. We do this by providing free and low-cost resources for local election administrators so they can update the ways they use technology to communicate with voters. We also do this by publishing free, open-source civic datasets that are used in some of the most powerful tools that drive civic participation. 

To date, we’ve built a knowledge network of hundreds of local election administrators through a program we call ELECTricity. And we have published civic datasets that answer questions like 'What’s on my ballot?' and 'Who represents me?', which have been accessed over 200 million times.
