DEPUTY DATA DIRECTOR OF REPORTING, FLORIDA DEMOCRATIC PARTY

The Florida Democratic Party is expanding our data and analytics team in advance of 2020 and are currently seeking a Deputy Data Director of Reporting. The candidate is tasked with development of working and collaborating with the senior executive team, the data team, County and Party officials, and the field team to develop easy-to-read reports that allow the Party to communicate department metrics, field targeting and voter contact as well as progress to goal with Party officials, candidates, elected leaders and donors.   

At the Florida Democratic Party we view the data department's core competency is to solve problems that involve data and information. As part of this core competency, we administer the VAN (our CRM) in partnership with county parties and campaigns. We create reports to support the work that staff and volunteers are doing throughout the state of Florida. Our team is responsible for targeting, using maps and statistical analysis to ensure we are speaking to the voters who most need to hear from us, that we are tracking progress to goals across all departments and ultimately that we are using data and analytics to ensure Democrats win.

While a broad skill set is always a plus, what we are really looking for is someone who can specialize and take ownership over a few aspects of our departmental work. So whether you are an experienced campaign staffer who is new to data, or a technical guru who is new to campaigns, or something in between, we want to hear from you. If you are interested in politics and want to join a team that is all about problem solving, we hope you will apply.
