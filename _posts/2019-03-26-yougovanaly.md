YouGov Blue is a custom research unit of YouGov serving Democratic and progressive clients. We leverage the panels, methodology, and technology infrastructure of YouGov to develop novel capabilities to help progressives succeed at the ballot and in the legislative arena. We are looking for individuals who are passionate about progressive candidates and causes as well as about statistics and survey methodology to come join us.

What will I be doing?
As a senior political analyst, you will work with our clients to design survey programs, set research goals, manage the logistics of projects, and report results. Youâ€™ll analyze and interpret opinion data, and advise our clients on how to apply our learnings. You should be as comfortable discussing the finer points of survey methodology as you are explaining them to people without a technical background.

What do I need to bring with me?
-- Extensive knowledge of survey research, including designing, fielding, and analyzing large-scale surveys and survey experiments
-- Experience performing data analyses in R, Python, or comparable software
-- Experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL
-- Ability to digest and communicate statistical information to
nontechnical stakeholders
-- Strong project management, attention to detail, and written and oral communication skills. 

Nice to haves:
-- Experience in building hierarchical and predictive models
-- Prior work or knowledge in digital marketing and ad tracking
-- Strong knowledge of Census and other geographic data and GIS
-- Prior work in client-facing and/or sales roles
-- Prior work experience for Democratic campaigns, polling or analytics firms, or other progressive organizations

Although this role will be ideally based in Washington DC, we are flexible to looking at any office or location across the US.
