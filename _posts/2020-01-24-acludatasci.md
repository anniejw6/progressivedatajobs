ACLU Analytics partners with teams across the organization to enable the ACLU to make smart, evidence-based decisions and bring quantitative insights on our issues to the courtroom and the public. Our team's work ranges from social science research for litigation & advocacy, to analysis & reporting for fundraising and engagement, to building and maintaining our data infrastructure. We strive to ensure the ACLU leads by example in the ethical use of data and technology. This includes maintaining our privacy and security standards, pushing for transparent data practices from government and corporate actors, and helping to steward high standards for algorithmic fairness, accountability, and transparency.

We are looking to hire a full-time Data Scientist to apply cutting-edge empirical methods from the social sciences to quantitative research questions that inform the ACLUâ€™s litigation, advocacy, and voter engagement work. This includes partnering with ACLU attorneys and organizers across a wide range of civil liberties issues to shape research questions, conduct analyses (ranging from descriptive analytics to causal inference modeling), and translate the results of statistical models and hypothesis tests for a non-technical audience. In 2020 and 2021, this role will focus heavily on ensuring a fair and non-partisan redistricting process, working in close partnership with our Voting Rights Project. We also expect this role to have an additional focus on support for our voting and constituent engagement work. This role reports to the Director of Legal Analytics & Quantitative Research.
