DigiDems collaborates with Democratic campaigns and organizations to ensure they have the tech skills, resources and support necessary to win. In 2018, DigiDems pioneered a new model; recruiting 80 technologists and embedding them in campaigns across the country, helping establish best practices for security, improving campaigns' use of technology, and designing and executing scalable digital outreach programs. In 2019 & 2020, DigiDems remains focused on ensuring progressive campaigns have both the talent and the technology necessary to succeed up and down the ballot.

Blue Leadership Collaborative (BLC) retains and develops high-potential future campaign managers--with an emphasis on women and people of color--by providing them with the professional and leadership development they need to run races in 2020. The BLC fellowship program is a full-time, three-month, paid leadership program designed to retain the strongest, most representative Democratic talent in the country.

As Development Director/Manager for DigiDems and the Blue Leadership Collaborative, youâ€™ll be a critical part of our HQ team, helping our brands secure the resources necessary to meet their programmatic and our strategic goals for 2020 and beyond. This is a new, full-time position, and we are looking for a determined, self-starting and detailed oriented individual who can embrace the challenge of building out the internal infrastructure needed to secure the necessary resources through a combination of major gifts, annual commitments, and individual donor solicitations.

The ideal person for this role has a depth of fundraising experience in the progressive ecosystem and with national donors. Political fundraising experience is a must. The strongest candidate will have experience managing a high-performing team and overseeing the fundraising or development operations of a political organization, campaign, or similar entity. Working knowledge of compliance implications that pertain to these types of organizations is a plus.
