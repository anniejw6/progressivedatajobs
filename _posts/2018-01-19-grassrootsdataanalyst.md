About this job: Our evaluation team at Grassroots Solutions is undertaking a multi-year, multi- nation evaluation and learning project for a philanthropic partner. We are assisting our client with the evaluation of their strategy and theory of change and providing real-time or as close to real- time feedback about progress and the impact of their work to address climate change. Together we have developed a plan to measure outcomes and impacts, track developments, frame challenges as they evolve, document the client’s emerging strategy, and suggest adaptations.

To meet our client’s growing information needs, we are expanding our team to include a data analyst and advisor. This is a part-time (approx. 35 hours per month), one-year contract position with the potential to renew for up to three years.

What you’ll bring: We are looking for someone who can bring their quantitative analytical skills, evaluation experience, and post-graduate knowledge to help our team assess the contribution of the client’s strategy and investments to mitigate climate change. The ideal candidate will bring an analytical mindset and experience with complex systems that will advise and help us strengthen our contribution methodology. In addition, they will be able to see the “forest for the trees” to help identify data gaps, provide recommendations for improving data collection and analysis, and know the difference between relevant data collection and data hoarding. 

At Grassroots Solutions, we openly embrace and engage in questions relating to race, power, and privilege internally and with our clients. A successful candidate will also have strong interpersonal and cross-cultural skills and enjoy the challenges that come with an evolving project.

What you’ll do:
* Review existing data sets, help determine data gaps, and (if applicable) recommend ways to address data gaps
* Develop and run multi-variable regression analyses with potentially large data sets
* Advise on refinements to existing methodologies for assessing the contribution of the client’s work
* Provide suggestions for undertaking comparative analyses and establishing counterfactuals
* Participate in discussions about what we are learning to inform reporting and other client deliverables

Other details: This position can be based anywhere, but the ability to regularly interact with our team (based in New York and Washington, D.C.) during East Coast business hours is important. The salary is $1,500 - $2,000/mo. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and do not discriminate against any protected classes. Grassroots Solutions is committed to equity, values diversity, and encourages people of all backgrounds and persuasions to apply for employment.
