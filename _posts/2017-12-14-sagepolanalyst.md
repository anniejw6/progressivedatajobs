Do you thrive on the rush of a campaign headquarters but would rather not move across the country? Are you fascinated with political data and research? If so this could be the perfect job to combine your love of politics with your analytical skills. 

Sage Media Planning & Placement is seeking smart, organized, and personable individuals for the campaign season (through November 2018) for Political Tracking Analyst positions in our Washington DC office. We are a Democratic firm with decades of expertise at all levels of political campaigns, from small mayoral races to national Super PACs. 

The Political Tracking Analyst will participate in all aspects of political media spending research for our candidate, issue and advocacy clients.

·         Analyzing, organizing, and distributing political competitive reporting in a timely & professional manner.

·         Having fun in a fast-paced environment.

Attention to numeric detail and organization a MUST, as is strong follow-through and ability to multi-task.  This role requires proven proficiency with spreadsheet and database software, and the numeric aptitude to use these tools effectively.

The ideal candidate possesses the political savvy to assess/prioritize the timeliness and importance of information being analyzed.
