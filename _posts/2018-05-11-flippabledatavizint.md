As Flippable’s Data Visualization Intern, you will transform complex sets of data into meaningful and compelling infographics, maps, and interactive media to shape the tone of informative content on state politics. Working on Flippable’s product team, you will manage requests for visualizations designed for internal strategic use and external consumption by our community. Your work will require the ability to merge thoughtful data insights with engaging design elements, a passion to work collaboratively with multiple teams, and a strong drive to complete projects independently. You will report to our Data Fellow.
Note: This is a full-time, 10- to 12-week internship running between June 11 and August 31.

Flippable is building a national movement to flip states from red to blue. We empower voters, volunteers, and donors with information that both educates and motivates them to support Democrats at the state level. Our primary activities are:
Raising awareness: We produce original digital content that highlights the critical role of state governments in a balanced democracy. Our content has been viewed over 100M times.
Running the numbers: We are building a model to identify which Democratic candidates donors should invest in -- where their dollars and time will have the greatest ROI. Our analysis shows where we are most likely to flip seats and, ultimately, the state chambers that have the greatest impact on redistricting and voting rights. 
Supporting candidates: We show our community the highest-impact ways to get involved through clear, tangible calls to action. Since November 2016, we have raised nearly $1,000,000 and deployed thousands of volunteers to support Democrats running in the most critical — and flippable — races.
