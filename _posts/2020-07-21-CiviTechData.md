About Civitech: Civitech is an Austin, Texas based startup that is applying modern technology-based solutions to civic problems. We are building elegant, usable interfaces that will help people run for public office, make it easier for volunteers to get involved in the civic arena, and offer modern solutions for local governments to better provide services to their constituents. 

Civitech simplifies the process of launching and running a campaign, from fundraising to voter outreach. Political campaigns are expensive and inefficient, frequently spending their limited resources reaching out to the same people over and over because the existing software solutions donâ€™t talk to each other. Civitech integrates with the existing software solutions, simplifies the big picture of a campaign, and uses social media and voter registration to reach out to voters who are frequently left out of the process.

To build truly transformational solutions, Civitech staff must reflect the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the voters, campaigns, and progressive organizations we serve. We strongly encourage women, people of color, first-generation Americans, new parents, single parents, people with disabilities, and members of the queer community to apply. 

About our Data Team: The Data Team is focused on building the most robust database of information about voting-eligible adults in the United States in the country. Our datasets cover voter registrations, voter history, statistical scores, contact information, campaign goals, campaign actions, mail tracking, web tracking, advanced address & geocode processes, election-related maps, election results, and more. 

Salary: Full-time, competitive salary

Location: Austin, TX
