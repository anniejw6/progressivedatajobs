Outvote, backed by YCombinator and Higher Ground Labs, was founded in 2017 as a get-out-the-vote tool for Democrats. Outvote has since expanded to become a distributed organizing platform allowing anyone to make an impact for the causes and candidates they care about. Our thesis is that grassroots activism at scale is better at changing hearts and minds than political ads. We empower activists with technology to make it easy to mobilize at in a way that is both impactful and coordinated with the campaigns and organizations that have been doing this vital work for decades.
In the 2018 midterms, Outvote helped build the biggest voter turnout in over 100 years. Users on Outvote contacted over 1 million voters. Columbia University’s Data Institute recently estimated that Outvote’s cost per vote was $2 in 2018, significantly lower than other political outreach methods. Outvote has been covered by The New York Times, Washington Post, TechCrunch, Fast Company, and many more.
In 2020, Outvote will be working with Planned Parenthood nationwide and 100+ Planned Parenthood affiliates, the DCCC in all supported congressional campaigns, multiple presidential primary candidates, Greenpeace on climate change reform, and more.
