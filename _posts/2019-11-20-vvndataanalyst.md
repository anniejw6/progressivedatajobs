Voices Vote Now (VVN) provides data and analytics consulting services for progressive organizations. This position will provide technical support for voter registration programs across the State Voices network and other organizations.

VVN seeks a Senior Data analyst with experience managing or analyzing large-scale programmatic data. The Senior Data Analyst will report to the Deputy Data Director. The Senior Data Analyst will be responsible for analyzing large datasets for patterns or trends that result in actionable recommendations to improve the efficiency of voter registration programs, with a secondary focus on providing as needed data support and reporting for voter registration programs in the field. The campaign will provide training and support to develop new skills, ranging from technical analytics and statistics to presentation and communication. This individual will be at the forefront of the campaign’s effort to develop metric-based programs integrated into a data-driven strategy, working closely with the campaign’s senior staff and partner organizations. The campaign seeks to hire for this position immediately to work through the 2020 cycle.


The Senior Data Analyst will:
* Use data to answer important questions about program effectiveness (such as: which types of field offices are best at registering people of color, which digital advertising track is most cost-effective, or how many unregistered people of color are projected to be in a given county in three years)
* Produce scalable and replicable code that help automate repetitive and manual analysis tasks
* Contribute to organizational and campaign strategy
* Independently generate research questions and project ideas
* Communicate clearly and effectively about technical topics with colleagues and partner organizations
* Design and deliver presentations and memos that summarize research and make actionable recommendations
* Help design and manage metrics for evaluating voter registration programs
* Provide backup data support to field organizations running registration programs on an as needed basis
* Other duties as assigned
 

This is a great opportunity for someone who:
* Has experience communicating technical subject matter to a less technical audience, resulting in a more efficient program, and strong written communication skills
* Is committed to the idea of changing the nature of the electorate
* Has a solutions-oriented approach and willingness to take initiative and offer solutions
* Has experience working on teams and is able to effectively divide up tasks
* Is interested in gaining project management experience
* Has a willingness to teach technical skills to other members of the team

* Strong knowledge of SQL and management of relational databases
* Strong object oriented programing knowledge (Python preferred)
* Understanding of Terminal and Unix command line interface
* Experience creating reports using data visualization & business intelligence tools, such as Tableau, PowerBI, Periscope, or Google Data Studio
* GIS (ArcGIS or QGIS) and mapping knowledge at an intermediate or higher level is highly preferred
* Experience analyzing or management of randomized controlled experiments
* Ability to write clear, clean code and a willingness to use version control systems like Github
* Previous experience using progressive data platforms (such as Civis Platform or BlueHQ)


Preferred but not required:
* Experience using APIs
