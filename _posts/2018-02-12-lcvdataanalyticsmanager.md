The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national, state and local priorities. LCV, in collaboration with our state LCV partners, advocates for sound environmental laws and policies, holds elected officials accountable for their votes and actions, and elects pro-environment candidates who will champion our priority issues.

LCV’s work to protect and advocate for the environment reflects the organization’s commitment to racial, social and environmental justice.  Engaging communities of color among other key constituencies for the environment is an organizational priority. Within the organization, we aim to create a workplace culture and policies and practices that demonstrate how we value equity and inclusion.

The LCV Education Fund advocates for strong environmental protections, organizes communities to speak up about their environmental values, and engages people in the democratic process in order to enact strong environmental laws.

The Data & Analytics Department makes decisions about which voters and members of the general public are likely to be engaged on environmental issues, and maintains voter file information that permits the organization to educate the public and motivate supporters to become active civic participants in an efficient manner. The Data & Analytics Manager will work with the Campaigns Department, Policy & Lobbying Department, Membership Department, Development Department, the Community and Civic Engagement Department and the state LCVs to develop and oversee data and targeting related activities on issues and elections.
