[Job description here](https://aflcio.hirecentric.com/jobs/124438.html).


The AFL-CIO builds unity across the labor movement to ensure all working people have the freedom to join together to negotiate a better life for themselves and their families. Our goal is to build power for all working people, and make every job a good job. We are ultimately accountable to 55 affiliated unions that represent over 12.5 million working people.

Our mission in the Data Infrastructure Department is to support this work. We aim to ensure that, as a labor movement, we’re running the strongest and most cost effective political and legislative mobilization, digital, and organizing campaigns that we possibly can. That takes a variety of forms: making central investments in tools and infrastructure to support many different kinds of users, direct service work, training, strategy consulting, etc. We serve a broad range of different clients across the labor movement.

What you would be doing, leading the Federation’s analytics work, is taking an evidence-based approach to help guide the strategic decision-making of the organization and our clients. We can observe things about the world - we collect data. We aim to use that data to inform our programmatic decision-making. We believe that strategic and tactical questions are answered through the scientific method and analysis, not gut feeling. In practice, here are a few of the many questions we’re grappling with:

What is our return on investment for different methods of volunteer recruitment? What does that mean for how we build volunteer capacity in the future?
How do we most accurately measure the views and electoral preferences of our members?
Who wants to join a union? How do we best find those folks and use that information to help the labor movement?
Do our member engagement tactics work? How do we make them more effective?

This position is on the leadership team for the department, and you will be co-leading the AFL-CIO data & analytics division with Michelle Penson (~10 staff). Michelle leads the internal team mechanics, so we’re looking for someone to help liaise with affiliates and other external stakeholders on issues of data and analytics. You won’t be writing code yourself, but having a background in statistics, databases, programming, analysis, or problem solving is helpful. We’ve been through a significant organizational restructuring, and you would be joining the team at a pivotal moment when we’re redefining what our work looks like.

If you're at all interested in applying, we urge you to begin the application process and submit your resume and cover letter to https://aflcio.hirecentric.com/jobs/124438.html by Tuesday, September 12. If you feel that you don't meet all of the qualifications, we'd encourage you to apply anyway. I also suggest reading Annie’s guide to work in progressive analytics: https://anniejw6.gitbooks.io/jobs-proganalytics/

This position pays $102,650.
