Presidential hiring outlooks (Last updated August 29th) 

Disclaimer: Progressive Data Jobs is not affiliated with any organization or campaign. We are not here to recommend any candidate nor to provide any opinions on the campaigns. This is a free and open resource, but if you are sharing this, please give us hat tip. Thanks!


For clarity, we have moved our [tips on getting a job with a Democratic Presidential campaign](https://www.progressivedatajobs.org/2019/07/15/gettingajobpres2020/) to a new link. If you haven't applied and worked for a Presidential election before, check it out first! We'll keep this post with updates from specific jobs and campaigns. 


Hiring list updated on a rolling basis as the campaign evolves[^1] - changes noted with "NEW" or "UPDATED" links and newly announced candidates or jobs. Candidates that drop out are noted at the bottom[^4]. 


These are categorized by whether they are specifically hiring for data & analytics at this time and ordered alphabetically by last name. If you have additional information or corrections please email lena at progressivedatajobs dot org.
