Thread is a super fast-moving, vision-driven community that is focused on positive outcomes. We believe in a Baltimore that is grounded in relationships across lines of race, class, and zip code. We want a more equitable city. Our community is over 2,000 strong with a central staff of 50 people that are unapologetically driven.

 

Thread staff is made up of strategic connectors, not of resource experts - we are a platform to empower the wider Thread community. We are data-centric and utilize numbers as a way to inform our practices towards our outcomes, but never let the numbers be the outcome. We believe consistent small acts create big difference. 

The Data Team Coordinator supports all functions of Threadâ€™s data operations including collection, management, reporting and user support. The Coordinator will work on projects to track the growth and strength of our community of over 400 students, over 1000 volunteers, and thousands of collaborators and prospective volunteers as we scale to 3000 volunteers and 1000 students in the next three years. 

As a highly data-motivated organization, staff is held accountable to over 250 metrics reported in Scorecards. The Coordinator will serve as the owner of these Scorecards. The Coordinator will work closely with staff to ensure they understand how their activity impacts their metrics; develop ad hoc reports in Salesforce to facilitate operational understanding; conduct deep analysis to support decision making at the direction of the Director of Data Strategy and Operations; develop custom tools in FormAssembly, Google Sheets, and other software to enable seamless data entry by staff and volunteers. In this capacity, the Coordinator will work on systems including, but not limited to, volunteer recruitment, volunteer management, academic data, fundraising and resource recruitment, performance management, and email marketing.
