Politech creates digital products and technology solutions for nonprofits, campaigns, and foundations. Our primary focus has been to assist progressive organizations, particularly those influencing the policy and political landscape, that advocate on behalf of underserved communities. Our software platforms have been a vital part of keeping such organizations successful and efficient. 

Who We Are

We are deeply committed to public service and progressive social change. We are 100% minority owned and operated with a diverse team, inclusive of gender, ethnicity, and race. 

Position Summary

Politech seeks a Full Stack Developer to join our team. We are looking for an individual with excellent communication skills who will work as a team player and a self-starter. The ideal candidate should have mid-level experience, but they won’t be placed in some hierarchical structure. This position will work directly with the other developers, and will report directly to the CEO. The individual should be highly motivated to make a difference and to have an impact on moving progressive issues forward. Our employees’ opinions matter to us for the success of the company, and we want you to bring creative solutions to make our work better for our clients. Interest and understanding of politics and campaigns is a plus but not required. 

Our employees are from all over the country, and bring varying levels of experience to the company. First and foremost, we value honesty from all employees within our firm.  We strongly encourage a work environment centered on open communication and conscientiousness. Working remotely gives our employees the ability to better maintain a work-life balance, but we expect that productivity and job performance will not be sacrificed.

We are a fully remote team so you will need to be flexible to work with staff in different time zones when necessary.



Salary: Commesurate
