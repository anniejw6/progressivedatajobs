TextOut is seeking a data fellow to join our team.  Our fellowship roles are for people who are excited about contributing to our cause while developing deeper professional expertise.  This role may be perfect for someone who is self-taught, completed a Bootcamp, comes from a non-technical major, or is switching careers. We expect you to have some basic core technical skills, but you do not have to be an expert.  Outside of tech, this role might be called an apprenticeship.


This is a remote, full-time position that can be based anywhere in the continental U.S. Pay is dependent on experience. There aren’t any additional benefits at this time. While this position is at-will, you are making a moral commitment (though not a legal one) through the conclusion of the November 2020 elections.

About You
* You are 18 or older and have a passion for data and politics.

* You may or may not be in school, pursuing a degree, or have a degree. It’s not required. You need to be committed to learning and hard work.

* You have access to a reliable desktop or laptop computer and stable, fast internet.

* You can commit no less than 40 hours per week to save democracy 

* You want to build connections with other like-minded progressives around the US.

* You adapt well to new technology and are a self-starter willing to teach yourself new software platforms.

* You’re into the idea of working and communicating remotely with your teammates using programs like Slack for chat and Asana for project management.

* You can work independently and are a natural problem solver but are also comfortable asking questions when you get stuck.

* You have basic SQL and Object-Oriented programming skills, and you are comfortable learning new programming languages.

* You have the highest ethical standards
