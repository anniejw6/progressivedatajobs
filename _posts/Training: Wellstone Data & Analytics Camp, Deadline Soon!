Wellstone is accepting applications through February 21st.

In 2017, we trained over 100 new data directors, from criminal justice advocates in the Midwest to electoral strategists fighting to flip Congress. Our participants left excited and committed to deeper engagement with data science and its capacity to support the movement.

So, this year, we’re making some changes: Data and Analytics Camp is now a hybrid online-in person program. Trainees will build a foundation of data analysis, standardization and strategy over four days in-person, before selecting a specialization to complete online. We’re excited to dive deeper into engineering, databases and building power online.

The online cohorts range from four to six weeks in length, with participants tackling real world organizing challenges in small groups in any of the following:

Python for Data Science
SQL with GIS
VAN Administration for Campaigns
HTML/CSS in Action Network 
Applications are now open: [https://wellstone.typeform.com/to/EXw77h](https://wellstone.typeform.com/to/EXw77h)
