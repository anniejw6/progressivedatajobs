EMILY’s List, the nation’s largest resource for women in politics, is searching for a Data
Assistant to join our Data and Technology team. EMILY’s List, the nation’s largest resource
for women in politics, has raised over $600 million to elect pro-choice Democratic women
candidates. With a grassroots community of over five million members, EMILY's List helps
Democratic women win competitive campaigns – across the country and up and down the ballot
– by recruiting and training candidates, supporting strong campaigns, researching the issues
that impact women and families, and turning out women voters to the polls. Since our founding
in 1985, we have helped elect 150 women to the House, 26 to the Senate, 16 governors, and nearly
1,100 women to state and local office. Nearly 40 percent of the candidates EMILY’s List has
helped elect to Congress have been women of color. During the historic 2017-2018 cycle,
EMILY’s List raised a record-breaking $110 million and launched a record independent
expenditure campaign. We helped elect 34 new women to the House, including 24 red-to-blue
victories; enough seats to have delivered the U.S. House majority alone. Since the 2016 election,
more than 46,000 women have reached out to EMILY's List about running for office laying the
groundwork for the next decade of candidates for local, state and national offices.
