Whistleblower Aid is a pioneering non-profit law firm that helps patriotic government workers and contractors to report and publicize wrongdoing they witness in their workplace â€” safely, lawfully and responsibly.  We've already had success (1) blocking Rick Perry's disastrous coal bailout with FERC, (2) stopping a criminal from confirmation to a post at CIA, and (3) exposing Rex Tillerson's violations of the Child Soldiers Protection Act.
Remote Opportunity

This is a new role at Whistleblower Aid with plenty of freedom and control to architect an improved production environment for all of our internal and external technology.

For this position, we're explicitly looking for someone experienced (3+ years DevOps / sysadmin experience) and confident in taking on a broad set of responsibilities managing, deploying and maintaining complex projects across several different environments. You should be comfortable receiving and giving constructive feedback, up for a challenge, and eager to learn.

We need someone to automate our backend processes using Puppet or Ansible to craft a secure server environment for all of our technology systems. In addition, we are seeking someone who is deeply knowledgeable in security.

Experience specifically relating to DevOps, Linux kernel hardening, key and access management, containerization, continuous integration, monitoring and performance management and having exceptional opsec is a huge advantage. You should be comfortable with Python, Go or Rust. Previous remote work and startup experience is also very valuable.

Responsibilities

* Automate the deployment and backend processes using Puppet or Ansible to create  secure and replicable environments
* Monitor performance across our services
* Review log files on a routine basis

* There are a lot of opportunities for growth at Whistleblower Aid as the team expands. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have as it makes our entire team stronger.
