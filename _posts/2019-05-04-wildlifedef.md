As Defenders of Wildlife works to grow our base of mid-level, major gift, planned giving and foundation donors, we seek a data specialist with fundraising experience to steward and manage constituent relationship management (CRM) operations for the Development team.

The Data Specialist will pair their philanthropy experience with database and data management expertise to synthesize, support and maximize the Development team’s effective use of our CRM, Revolution Online: ROI. Working closely with our Database Architect, they will drive project management on behalf of Development to identify, scope, prioritize and, as appropriate, implement system recommendations to best align the software with Development needs.

In close partnership with the Database Architect and the Development team, the Data Specialist is responsible for reviewing and maintaining the Development department’s business rules, reporting requirements and best practices for the maintenance of discrete and aggregated donor information. In addition to conducting routine and special-project data entry, the Data Specialist will: conduct data entry, working to ensure data integrity and quality; streamline reporting and effective data extraction; promote donor data privacy compliance; develop, execute and analyze customized reports, as needed; and coordinate or execute reporting needs for Development, as appropriate. This person will serve as the first point of contact for Development staff with projects, questions or issues involving the CRM, working with the Database Architect when appropriate to address needs or concerns. They will be an advocate, champion and steward for Development in all areas regarding ROI and will be tasked with finding solutions to data use questions and challenges.

While the discrete tasks and workflow of this role are likely to be cyclical in nature, we anticipate this role will spend 80% of the time on project based work and 20% of the time on operational functions.

Salary:$50,000.00 to $65,000.00
