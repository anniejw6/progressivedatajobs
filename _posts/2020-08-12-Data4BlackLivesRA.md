Position Description: 

Data for Black Lives is a movement of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people. Since the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.
 
But history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise. 

The Research Associate is a crucial member of the Data for Black Lives research team and will be responsible for assisting with the coordination of programs and initiatives outlined in the research agenda. This is a full-time position, reporting directly to the Director of Research. The Research Associate will support the Director of Research by managing the administration and facilitation of programs and engagement projects that enable the public and aspiring data leaders to become change agents in the Data for Black Lives movement. The Research Associate will utilize strong attention to detail and a confident ability to effectively communicate with various stakeholders in order to deliver an approach to research that centers Black communities at every stage.
