[Job description here](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/cchr/downloads/pdf/careers/DDS_HumanRights.pdf)
The Commission on Human Rights (the Commission) is the agency charged with enforcing
the New York City Human Rights Law (City Human Rights Law) – one of the most expansive
civil rights laws in the nation. Through its Law Enforcement Bureau (LEB), the Commission
accepts claims filed by the public, and has the power to initiate its own investigations to
affirmatively root out discrimination, harassment, retaliation and other violations of the
NYCHRL. The Commission’s Community Relations Bureau (CRB) is empowered to take
action against prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, discrimination and bias-related violence or
harassment through education, trainings, outreach efforts, and other mechanisms aimed at
creating partnerships and relationships with stakeholders in the community. Both bureaus
collaborate closely to work towards the shared goal of fostering mutual understanding and
respect among all New Yorkers and encouraging equality of treatment throughout the City.
Working closely with the Deputy Commissioner for Strategic Initiatives and the Chief
Information Officer, the Data Discrimination Specialist will support the Commission’s data
discrimination project, which focuses on discrimination resulting from the combination of
“big data” and predictive analytics. The Data Discrimination Specialist will assist
Commission staff to further develop its public outreach and education strategy in this area.
