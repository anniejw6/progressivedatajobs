Everytown is a movement of Americans working together to end gun violence and build safer communities. Gun violence touches every town in America. For too long, change has been thwarted by the Washington gun lobby and by leaders who refuse to take common-sense steps that will save lives. But something is changing. More than 4 million mayors, moms, cops, teachers, survivors, gun owners, and everyday Americans have come together to make their own communities safer. Together, we are fighting for the changes that we know will save lives. Everytown starts with you, and it starts in your town.

Everytown seeks a Data Manager to work with the Data department to maintain and assist in managing the many day-to-day tools and processes used to organize, report, and analyze work done in this organization. This is an ideal opportunity for a creative and mission-driven data practitioner who wants to expand their skill set and be a part of the gun violence prevention movement.


Salary: (unconfirmed, believed to be over 65k)
