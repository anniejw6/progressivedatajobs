YouGov Blue is a new unit of YouGov exclusively serving Democratic and progressive clients. We leverage the panels, methodology, and technology
infrastructure of YouGov to develop novel capabilities to help progressives succeed at the ballot and in the legislative arena. We are looking for individuals who are
passionate about both fighting for Democratic and progressive candidates and causes and about statistics and survey methodology to come join us.
As a political analyst/senior political analyst, you will work with our clients to design survey and modeling programs, set research goals, manage the logistics of
projects, and report results. Youâ€™ll analyze and interpret opinion and modeling data, and advise our clients on how to apply our learnings. You should be as comfortable
discussing the finer points of survey design and methodology as you are explaining those points to people without a technical background.

We care more about your experience and skills than your schooling, but the relevant educational background is a Bachelors or Masters in the quantitative social
sciences, statistics, or other relevant scientific areas.
