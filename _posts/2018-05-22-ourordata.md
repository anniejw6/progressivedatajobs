Our Oregon is a 501(c)(4) organization dedicated to fighting for economic and social fairness for all Oregonians. Our coalition represents organizations and individuals who care about a range of issues, from preserving funding for our schools and critical services to protecting the environment.
Our accomplishments have included defeating Bill Sizemoreâ€™s many destructive ballot measures, securing the passage of crucial initiative protection bills, and bringing together an unprecedented coalition of groups
to pass Measures 66 & 67 to fund schools and services. Currently Our Oregon works to fund K-12 schools, healthcare and senior services by holding large and out-of-state corporations accountable to pay their fair share in taxes.

Description of Duties
As Data Director, you will be part of the core team managing and implementing a wideranging plan for progress in the state. The Data Director reports directly to the Executive Director and collaborates with
staff to design and implement data and targeting strategies. In addition, the Data Director acts as the general data expert for the state, helping partner organizations develop data plans, access voter data, and
build targeting programs. This also includes designing and running data trainings.

To succeed, applicants will need to demonstrate motivation; the ability to manage multiple projects; strong VAN, Microsoft Excel, and data analysis skills; and the ability to work closely with a large and diverse
group. Applicants with prior campaign experience in data and targeting tied to the political process will be given preference.

This is a high demand position. Our Oregon serves a variety of campaigns and organizations and success in this position requires the ability to juggle a variety of demands at a high volume, and to organize time and
resources efficiently. In addition, the position has room for creativity, long-term planning and in-depth analysis, and will be best performed when staff can easily manage daily demand while simultaneously
developing longer term projects. Depending on workload, the Data Director may eventually need to oversee additional staff.
