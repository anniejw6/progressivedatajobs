Win|Win is a network of progressive organizations coming together to advance racial, social, and economic equity across Washington through civic and political engagement. Our partners work together to build a new political landscape that inspires people; where individuals engage because they see themselves and their values reflected across our democracy. Win|Win provides our network with strategic coordination, data and research, and individual technical assistance to increase our ability to create change together.

We are looking for a self-starter with strong customer service and problem solving skills to fill this position working closely with partners to provide ongoing support and assistance with the Voter Activation Network (VAN), a statewide voter file, and field engagement tools that help advance the missions of our partners. The Data & VAN Administrator will be part of our program team and supervised by the Associate Director.

All staff are expected to provide leadership and proactive learning to advance our mission, vision, and core strategies. The Data & VAN Administrator will be expected to act as a champion for the Win|Win Network and our partners by understanding their programs and trends impacting the communities they serve.
