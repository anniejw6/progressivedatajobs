Founded in 2016, For Our Future Action Fund and For Our Future run the largest, permanent progressive field program across key states. Our vision is to expand the progressive infrastructure and advance economic prosperity for all, strong community schools, climate justice, and racial and social justice. Along with community partners and volunteers, we consistently engage with people in face-to-face conversations around what issues matter most to them. By organizing people in lasting relationships, we win elections, drive local progress, make a community’s collective voice heard, and help build the transformative power needed to improve people’s lives.

In 2018, we made over 10 million door knocks and held 1.5 million face-to-face conversations with voters in 7 states. Our turnout operation and innovative program helped restore voting rights to 1.4 million Floridians, expand Medicaid coverage to 400,000 in Virginia, and resulted in sizable electoral progress at the state and federal level, including the pickup of 3 Governor mansions, 1 Senate seat, 13 Congressional seats, and 22 state legislative seats.

For Our Future will continue to grow and win through 2020, building power across issue fights and elections. Headquartered in Washington, DC, our current state programs include Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

JOB SUMMARY
For Our Future Wisconsin seeks a Data Manager. Qualified candidates will have experience working with voter file targeting, tracking, data systems, reporting, progress-to-goal, and program analysis. The work will include administration of VAN, Getthru, and Empower (a relational organizing tool).  

For Our Future is proud to run a data-driven program, and that isn’t possible without dynamic and mission-driven data teams helping to drive each state’s program.

For Our Future Wisconsin is a statewide coalition organization that builds progressive power through voter engagement and organizing within communities around key issues and candidates.
