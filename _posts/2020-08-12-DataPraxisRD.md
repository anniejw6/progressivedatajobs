Datapraxis works to help democracy flourish. Our partners include leading progressive parties, non-profits and research institutes across Europe. Our work combines expertise in strategy, research, data science and modelling, message-testing, campaigns and digital engagement. 

We are now seeking a Research Director and/or Chief Data Scientist to join our leadership team. This is an exciting senior role, perfect for someone with deep expertise in public opinion research and/or data science in the social & political arenas. 

The purpose of this role is to provide management and leadership for Datapraxis’s research, development and innovation programmes. We are looking for exceptional candidates who combine rigour with creativity; who balance deep understanding with a pragmatic, hands-on attitude to delivering results; and who are motivated to use their skills to make the world a better place. 

You will play a vital role in helping Datapraxis deliver on its vision, by refining and building on our current research and data analytics techniques, and by exploring, testing and developing new approaches to generate deeper insights and to help our partners achieve their goals. 

The ideal candidate will have deep knowledge of quantitative research methods, significant experience of applied data analytics or domain-relevant modelling techniques, an interest in large-scale natural language processing and/or qualitative methods, strong communications skills, and project and line management experience. An interest in the dynamics of public opinion, politics and social change is also essential.

We are open to applications from emerging or seasoned leaders who have specialised most deeply in only one of these technical areas (research or data science), provided that they can demonstrate sufficient interest in and understanding of the other aspects of the role. The precise job title and role description can also be tailored to the successful candidate’s expertise and specialisms, as we are also recruiting other roles alongside this one.

Innovation, Testing and Development - overall responsibility for this workstream, collaborating closely with our leadership team on strategy, and with analysts and project teams on specific opportunities for innovation and development. 
* Working with our team and contractors to review and improve our current analytics techniques (including but not limited to cluster analysis, predictive modelling, multi-level regression with post-stratification (MRP) methods, and natural language processing). 
* Horizon-scanning for new techniques and working to expand our repertoire, ensuring that we are testing new research and analytics methods in an agile way that contributes to our mission. 
* Scoping and evaluating opportunities for third party data licensing, acquisition and integration.
* Working with the senior data scientist to progressively optimise our data centre environment. 
* Continually exploring new fieldwork partners, to ensure that we can deploy a diversity of research approaches.
* Working with partners on innovative joint projects, for example in the arena of online media and social media monitoring and analysis. 

Long-term multi-country insights programme - leading the research elements of this programme, working closely with the Managing Director and a dedicated analyst:
* Designing, developing and overseeing the research programme, which involves large-sample research over multiple years to investigate deeper trends, patterns and drivers of opinion.
* Coordinating this research with R&D and product development, while ensuring that it helps build up Datapraxis’s backbone data assets. 
* Contact and engagement with funding partners and clients.  
* Ensuring that products and outputs are of an excellent quality. 

Management and leadership responsibilities, both internally in the organisation, and externally with our partners and communities of practice:
