You’re an experienced engineering leader, you want to be part of a company at the forefront of measuring public opinion, and you’re eager to have a massive impact on elections in 2020 and beyond.

You are committed to giving back to fighting for what you believe in, and making impactful choices in your everyday life. You wish your career could reflect your commitment to civic engagement, but you’re not sure if there are really jobs that equally value social impact, tech innovation, and business success. There are.

In 2017, we created a new way to quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online. We use this technology to guide forward-thinking candidates and causes and create winning strategies with them. 

Change Research is innovating to solve critically-important problems at the intersection of data, social science, and politics. And in doing this, we hope to make our democracy better.

Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to our values. We invite folks with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer. Join us.

About the role:

As the head of our engineering team, you will lead the team of 3+ software engineers that builds the software underlying our fast, affordable, accurate approach to polling. This is an important role in our company and you will head up our technology efforts and play a key role in product and strategic decision making with other leaders at Change Research.

* You are a curious, data-driven leader. You are product-oriented, and you’re committed to take on technical and product challenges as we ramp up in the face of heavy demand for polling around the 2020 elections and beyond. You’re comfortable running meetings, mentoring colleagues, diving into code, and collaborating across different parts of the company to get things done.
* We are a team of engineers who are comfortable wearing multiple hats.  We are full-stack developers (backend/frontend) and “full-stack data” engineers (data pipelines and analytics and/or machine learning).


Salary: $120,000 - $180,000 annually, commensurate with experience
