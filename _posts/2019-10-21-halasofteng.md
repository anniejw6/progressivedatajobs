Hala is a social enterprise working to transform the nature of protection and accountability in the worldâ€™s
toughest places by democratizing advanced defense, sensing, and artificial intelligence technology. Hala is
currently saving lives, reducing trauma, and improving resilience for millions of people.
We are a team of 32 working together around the world to solve difficult problems. Founded by a rocket
scientist, an ex-diplomat, and an expert in using technology for good, we hail from leading educational,
research, and business institutions (including Stanford, MIT, Wharton, Cambridge, UCL, Imperial, LBS,
MIT-Lincoln Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, Deloitte, Booz, and the World Bank) and are
united by a mission to create a sustainable business that provides massive social impact.
We are looking for a strong Software Engineer with experience developing single page, serverless apps
using Node. Our existing systems and current development uses AWS, so while not required, AWS
experience is a big plus. The Software Engineer reports directly to the Lead Software Engineer, and
interfaces with the Product and Design teams.

Hala Systems is based in Lisbon, Portugal. This is a full-time remote position, with the option to relocate to
Lisbon (sponsorship available). The candidate is expected to have previous remote experience or feel
confident in their ability to supply the appropriate work environment, including a sufficient internet
connection, appropriate workspace, and other typical remote/home office needs. The team is split between
Europe and the US, so we expect availability during crossover periods between locations.


Salary: $110,000-$125,000 for mid-level; USD $125,000-$145,000 for senior level
