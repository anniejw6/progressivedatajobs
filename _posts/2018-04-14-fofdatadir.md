In our continuous pursuit to be one of the biggest campaigns on the IE side, For Our Future is looking to bring more unique voices onto our team!

For our Future is super excited to announce that we are hiring Data Directors in the following states:
Nevada
Pennsylvania
Ohio

The Data Director will work closely with the Field and State Director to execute our mission of building a community-driven movement that yields high turnout for progressives at the polls and overall improvement on engagement in the political process. Data Directors don’t have to have a ton of Data experience to be good at this role and is a great stepping stone for folks who want to come over to Data from Field. Folks who have never worked in the IE space before are encouraged to apply. 

We’re also hiring for Field and Comms both in our states and in Washington, DC!
