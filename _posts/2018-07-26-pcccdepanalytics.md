The PCCC seeks a Deputy Analytics Director to assist with data analysis and support for online organizing, including our email and online ad programs. The PCCC is a virtual work environment, this position can be based anywhere.

The Analytics team runs our digital advertising and online merchandising efforts, we build lists, raise money, and help pilot many tools and strategies that other departments use. We work most closely with our email team by cleaning and growing their list, and testing their tactics. Youâ€™ll need to think outside the box.

Responsibilities include:

Digital advertising and donor prospecting. Assist with all aspects of digital advertising testing, staging, production, and results tracking. We run our ads in-house from start to finish. We run large-scale acquisition, direct-to-donate, and swap campaigns on Facebook and other platforms, and use ads to creatively supplement organizing needs, like promoting our candidate trainings.

Testing and scaling our marketing and member engagement tactics. Make our organizing bigger and better by A/B testing our tactics -- this can include recurring donor retention strategies, increasing calls from our call alert emails, field experiments, or page design tests. The Analytics team is also in charge of growing revenue from our fast-growing online store and merchandise programs -- we sell thousands of items a year.

Database maintenance. Developing and automating reports, maintaining membership record and donation databases, and survey analysis.

Staff support. Supporting other PCCC staff by pulling membership lists for PCCC staff, developing and automating reports.

Other duties as assigned by the Analytics Director. Every day is different and we are often called in to help with challenges across multiple teams.
