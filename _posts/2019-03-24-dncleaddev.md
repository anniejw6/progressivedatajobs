The mission of the Mobilization Department at the Democratic National Committee is to bring ordinary people into the heart of the DNC and provide grassroots supporters with encouragement, power, and the tools to mobilize in their communities.
Weâ€™re looking for a Lead Developer to manage development of our largest website properties, IWillVote.com and Democrats.org. The person in this role will be based on the Mobilization team but will work closely with our Tech team to test and optimize user experience and accessibility. The Mobilization team at the DNC is a group of digital practitioners who focus on building communities of grassroots supporters online. Most of the people on our team are not engineers but we have the vision behind how our supporters should interact with us via our web properties. This role is ideal for a self-starter who has worked with cross-functional teams before or is patient and willing to translate engineering work into layman's terms for practical use.
