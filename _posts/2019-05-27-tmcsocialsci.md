The Movement Cooperative seeks a qualified Social Scientist to manage and execute research projects on behalf of our membership. An ideal candidate is committed to helping progressive organizations make sound decisions based on existing and original survey research. As an organization, TMC tries to prioritize equity in all aspects of our work and elevate the voices and experiences of marginalized individuals and communities. This is especially true in our research, as our highest priority is to fill gaps and contribute to the discourse around advocacy and movement building in ways that mainstream research consultancies do not.
