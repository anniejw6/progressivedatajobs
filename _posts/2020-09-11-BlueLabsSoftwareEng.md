BlueLabs is a leading provider of analytics services and technology for government, business, and campaigns. Founded in 2013 by senior members of the Obama for America re-election campaign analytics team, we help our clients optimize their engagements with individual customers, supporters and stakeholders to achieve their goals. Today, our team counts over 50 data scientists, engineers, and strategists from diverse backgrounds who share a passion for using data to solve the world’s greatest social and analytical challenges. We’ve served more than 400 organizations ranging from political campaigns to advocacy groups, unions, government agencies, and international groups, as well as companies in the automotive, travel, consumer packaged goods, entertainment, healthcare, media, telecom, and other industries. Along the way, we’ve developed innovative tools in analytics, media optimization, reporting, and influencer outreach.

The Government Practice

The BlueLabs Government Analytics practice is at the forefront of revolutionizing the ways that citizens use and learn about government services. Our team specializes in creating personalized nudges that empower people with the information they need to take action and make informed choices. We work closely with internal government innovation groups, and build on the analytics informed feedback loops pioneered in e-commerce, advocacy, politics, and consumer finance.



The Role

You will join a small engineering team building and supporting the infrastructure used by the analysts and data scientists for our engagements across the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Many of the team’s needs are similar across projects: most analysts interact with data using SQL and python, we often work with daily batch data from upstream sources, and we do extensive processing of raw data to make it usable for analytics. This creates an opportunity for a platform-based approach. You will work to improve our standardized analyst-facing platform services and also work on specific data-intensive project needs.

In this position, you will:
* Alongside other engineers on the Government Infra/DevOps team, deploy and operate our cloud data infrastructure to support our government program teams.
* Work with members of our Government Practice to solve problems, deploy the tools they need to get their jobs done, and build playbooks so others can solve these problems in the future.
* Ensure availability and security of systems through investigation and resolution of issues, and documentation and execution of routine maintenance operations.
 
This position is based in our offices in Washington, DC working alongside the rest of our government practice. As part of the ongoing COVID-19 response, we are working fully remotely and expect to continue to do so through much of the year. Permanent remote work will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

You likely have:
* Interest in building infrastructure to support data analysis/data science and in automating tasks that make sense to automate
* Experience with AWS (our primary cloud provider), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform
* A basic knowledge of Linux systems, networking and security


You may have:
* Familiarity with infrastructure automation tools like Terraform (which we use)
* Experience with analytics databases like Vertica, Redshift, and Snowflake and common data engineering tools such as Airflow or Databricks
* Experience with containerization and cluster orchestration, specifically Docker and Kubernetes
* Demonstrated interest in using data and technology to advance social good in areas like health, education or civic engagement


In order to be qualified for this position you must currently have or be able to obtain and maintain a public trust security clearance, which requires either US Citizenship or 3 years of US residency.
