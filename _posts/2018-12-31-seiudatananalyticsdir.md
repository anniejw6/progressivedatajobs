We are seeking a Director to lead the creation and operation of a new, well-resourced Data Systems and Analytics Department.

We expect the department to include at least 15-20 staff members, including 12-15 by the end of the first year.  

In addition to developing and managing the integrated data system, this multi-team department will be responsible for data quality, reporting, technology, and providing regular data support to SEIU local unions, campaigns and departments.
