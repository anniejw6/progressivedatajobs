The Center for Voter Information is a progressive 501(c)(4) nonprofit that works to engage and inform both the RAE as well as the broader electorate.

In the 2018 cycle, VPC and CVI communicated with more than 50 million individuals, almost always holding out control groups to measure the net impact of their programs. VPC and CVI have been leading innovators in the field of voter registration, GOTV and experiment-informed programs and are always exploring new digital and other technologies. VPC and CVI’s scientific approach to their work is constantly reshaping how voter registration and GOTV are conducted by VPC and CVI and other like-minded groups.

Position Description:

The Analyst will help develop and execute a strategic data-driven research program supporting VPC and CVI’s missions. Reporting to the Director of Analytics, the Analyst will be a key part of a small but ambitious analytics team and will be expected to contribute to all aspects of the analytics team’s work.

The Analyst will contribute to a range of data projects, including developing and managing databases, reporting, research, testing, and analysis. The Analyst should be able to communicate clearly and effectively and should be detail-oriented, flexible, and a self-directed problem solver.

A talented Analyst will help VPC and CVI expand their scope and increase their efficiency as their work continues to grow. Looking forward the analytics team will improve VPC and CVI’s data management, develop new tools for reporting and data visualization, evaluate existing predictive models, help build new predictive models, and conduct innovative research.
