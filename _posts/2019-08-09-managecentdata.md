The Management Center (TMC) is seeking a Data Director to support our growing team by ensuring we efficiently track progress to our ambitious goals and that data is a strength of our organization. We’re looking for candidates who are meticulous about details while remembering the people and impact behind the numbers, who are excited to support the progressive and educational equity movements, and who thrive on solving problems and making systems more efficient.

Who We Are

Our mission is to help social change leaders learn how to build and run more effective organizations so they can deliver great results. Founded in 2006, we’re now a 40+ person, $10 million organization (and growing!). We've helped shape the practices of hundreds of influential organizations and thousands of individual managers, with a particular focus on leading progressive organizations working for social change.

Our clients work on issues – like promoting immigration reform, fighting for racial, economic and gender justice, advocating for educational equity, and protecting voting rights – where they face an inherently uphill battle and so must fight more effectively than their opponents if they are going to win. We aim to help them do that by making their organizations as effective as possible, by providing coaching, training, and publications for the broader field.

The Data Director is an integral member of the team who will work across programs and sectors within the organization to capture and report on data.

What You’ll Do

As TMC’s staff, client demand, and revenue have grown, our data has become much more complex. The Data Director, who will report directly to TMC’s Chief of Staff, is in charge of ensuring data is a strength of our organization by acting as a project manager, systems owner, and chief streamliner.



Salary: $71,400-$102,000
