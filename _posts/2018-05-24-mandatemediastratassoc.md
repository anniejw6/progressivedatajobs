Who we are: Mandate Media is a progressive political consulting firm specializing in digital strategy and services. We help Democratic political candidates and progressive advocacy groups integrate their strategy with technology. We design and build websites. We provide interactive campaign tools. We advise on and manage our clients’ social media and digital advertising. We help our clients build big email lists, engage those audiences in activism, and raise lots of money. We do political research and manage databases. Our clients are changing the world, and we help them win.

What's the job? This is a full-time Portland-based job in a small, fast-growing, well-respected firm.  Every day will be different, and you'll be using your skills to help change the world.  We're a small shop, and you'll be a critical member of our team.
You will use data and analytics to support the work of our lead strategists in advising our clients. You will use data to analyze and inform our clients’ email programs.  You’ll produce regular reports on fundraising performance and return on investment.  You’ll propose new ideas for testing and segmentation.  You will partner with our strategists to bring rigor to acquisition and persuasion advertising.   You’ll work with our clients and their progressive allies to manage the data in “joint actions”, collaborative opt-in list-building projects.
In this role, you will become fluent in how data and communications work together to produce winning campaigns. You will maintain an interest in and knowledge of the strategic landscape of our clients' efforts, identify political risks and opportunities, and proactively offer online solutions to our clients’ challenges.
In a business that is both art and science, you’ll add the science to our creative stew.

Skills required: Strong interest in politics and a desire to win. A strong aptitude for data analysis, attention to detail and ability to communicate about data to mere mortals. Strong skills and comfort with Microsoft Excel is a must. Other statistical and data tools are a big bonus.

Who are we looking for? We're looking for someone who is smart, fast, flexible, creative, and happy. We're looking for self-starters who want to expand their skills, take on tough challenges, and make this job their own. We want someone comfortable with analyzing data – but with the skill and confidence to make strong recommendations to our team and our clients. The work will come at you fast and furious, so adaptability and time-management skills are critical.

Compensation: $38,000 to $42,000 per year, commensurate with experience. Generous health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and alternative care. Generous paid-time-off package and 401K plan.

Resumes: Please send a cover letter, resume, and writing sample. Your letter and/or resume should describe, in detail, your experience and skills with analyzing data. Your writing sample should either be a sample of a past data analysis project, or a brief discussion of a previous data analysis project you conducted. (How long? Shorter is better. But not too short!) All materials should be sent to jobs@mandatemedia.com.

Process: This position is open until filled, but we are moving quickly.  We will review applications starting on May 14 – for maximum consideration, submit your materials immediately.
Once we receive your materials, we'll contact you about the next steps in the process.  If you have any questions, email Chelsie Kinney at jobs@mandatemedia.com.  No calls, please.  Mandate Media is an equal opportunity employer.
