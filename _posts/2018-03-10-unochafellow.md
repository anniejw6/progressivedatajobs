The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has a Centre for Humanitarian Data in The Hague, the Netherlands to help increase the use and impact of data in the humanitarian sector. The vision is to create a future where all people involved in a humanitarian emergency have access to the data they need, when and how they need it, to make responsible and informed decisions.
Deadline: March 31, 2018

The Centre focuses on four areas: data services, data policy, data literacy, and network engagement. The Centreâ€™s data services work includes direct management of the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform and the Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL) data standard. The data literacy work focuses on improving the data skills of technical and non-technical humanitarians. For data policy, the Centre works with partners to develop institutional agreements for sharing data in crisis settings. Finally, the Centre works to further build and engage an active community in support of its mission and objectives through a number of events and communication activities.

Data Fellows Programme

The Centre will host its inaugural class of Fellows in The Hague in June and July 2018. Through this programme, Fellows will come together to design and deliver targeted projects that contribute to the overall goals of the Centre. The 2018 Fellows will focus on four areas where the Centre is seeking new perspectives, insights and partnerships including Data Science, Data Storytelling, Predictive Analytics, and User Experience Research. The Fellowship programme will be residential, with Fellows living and working in The Hague under the direction of the Data Fellows Programme Coordinator and with support from the entire Centre team.

We are seeking four Fellows for the 2018 class, one Fellow per focus area. Support for the first class of Fellows is being provided as part of the OCHA partnership with, inter alia, Education Above All Foundation that works to improve access to quality education for vulnerable and marginalized people in the developing world.
