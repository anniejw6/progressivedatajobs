Organization Overview

The Alliance for Safety and Justice (ASJ), a national project of the Tides Center, aims to replace prison waste with new safety priorities rooted in prevention and community health. To accomplish these goals, ASJ partners with state leaders, state-based advocates, crime survivors and influential allies to advance policy reforms that will significantly reduce incarceration rates in the criminal justice system.

Currently operating in six states, ASJ advances justice reform through alliance building, issue education, crime survivor organizing and policy advocacy. ASJ is committed to both reforming state justice systems and empowering the communities most harmed by concentrated crime and over-incarceration. ASJ is the sister organization of Californians for Safety and Justice, a project of the Tides Center (www.safeandjust.org) and Alliance for Safety and Justice Action Fund, a 501(c)4 project of The Advocacy Fund.
