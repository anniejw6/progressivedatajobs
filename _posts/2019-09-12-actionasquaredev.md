Action Builder is an organizing CRM from Action Network, a not-for-profit technology company building infrastructure for the progressive movement. We care passionately about creating a better world, and build the tools to make that world a reality.  

The person in this role will be a crucial utility player, ensuring our AWS architecture remains stable while implementing new features on our Rails/GraphQL backend. You will join a team with a half time dev ops architect, a full time backend developer, a full time Javascript dev and a full time design technologist (design, CSS/HTML).


The Role
Our tool entered rolling launch mode six months ago, and is being used by organizers across the US and Canada. We have two backend developers, a javascript developer, a design technologist and soon, you, a developer comfortable with optimizing AWS architecture, expertise in Rails and some familiarity with GraphQL. You should be comfortable working with an existing code base, while also creatively diving into solutions for optimizing our systems and workflows.



Salary: $95,000-$110,000 annually
