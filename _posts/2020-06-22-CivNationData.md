ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW
Civic Nation believes that empowering people to take action can change culture. We address
key social issues – access to education, gender equality, civic engagement and dismantling
hate/discrimination – and keep them at the forefront of dialogue and policy. Rather than
approach these issues only with the intent to change policy, we are building grassroots
movements to change the world—from the ground up.

Through organizing, engagement and public awareness we work with public and private partners
to inspire, educate and activate people around the issues that are important to our country.
Our initiatives empower people to be agents of change in their own lives. We inspire with
culturally relevant content that captures attention and sparks action. We educate by providing
direct access to information, tools and resources. We activate by helping communities organize
by supplying toolkits, campaign materials and digital tools.

Current initiatives include the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, It’s On Us, The United State
of Women, and #VoteTogether. Civic Nation also leads the Creative Alliance, a band of creative
and communication experts who use their powers for the good of the country; and works in close
collaboration with the organization, When We All Vote.

Civic Nation is located in Washington, DC.
