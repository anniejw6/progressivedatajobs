Data and Analytics Camp (DAC) is part of re:power Academy. DAC equips progressive leaders with the cutting edge data and analytics skills necessary to support electoral campaigns and issue based organizing. Applicants will be asked to commit to full participation of an intensive 5-day in-person training.

We pull from the best practices in data, analytics, engineering and organizing to help campaigners and activists build winning online and offline campaigns.

Our curriculum is grounded in a framework of inclusive politics: we center the leadership of people who’ve been traditionally shut out of tech roles — people of color, women,queer and trans folks, the working class and people living at the intersections of those identities. We get real about the ways race, class, gender, sexuality, and power shape our lives, tools and campaigns. Our approach to technology is defined by our communities’ wisdom: the needs of our people are the way to build power.

Ideal candidates can come from all walks of life: data practitioners looking to sharpen their skills and complete beginners passionate about organizing are equally welcome.

Applications are now open for DAC in Atlanta until July 24.
