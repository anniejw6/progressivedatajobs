Win/Win is a network of progressive organizations coming together to advance racial, social, and
economic equity across Washington through civic and political engagement. We provide strategic
coordination, data and research, and individual technical assistance to increase our partners’ collective
ability to create change.
Win/Win focuses on creating a new political landscape that inspires people; where individuals are
engaged because they see themselves and their values reflected across our democracy; in the policies
we advocate, the campaigns we organize, and leaders we elect. We focus on big picture opportunities to
collaborate across different organizations on shared goals that will address systemic disparities, increase
community power, and advance wins that truly impact people’s lives.
