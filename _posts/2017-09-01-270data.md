At 270 Strategies, we know that effective programs are grounded in data — we work with clients to calculate their quantitative goals and establish accountability systems. We also help clients use polling and modeling to create data-driven campaigns and initiatives. Now, we’re growing our data and analytics team to include a Data & Analytics Analyst who will regularly engage with firm clients and provide expertise on data targeting, modeling, and applications.

The Data Analyst will work with the 270 Strategies data team to develop data-driven strategies and manage client needs across multiple projects. The ideal candidate is a fast and scrappy learner with experience incorporating data into actionable programs and will be well-versed in translating complex analyses for a campaign or organizational decision-makers.

This position will be based in Washington, D.C. or Chicago, IL and requires some travel.
