The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee's mission is to win Democratic majorities and build Democratic power in state legislatures. 

In the 2018 cycle, Democrats flipped over 400 state legislative seats and gained eight new Democratic majorities. This is the most chambers flipped since the 2006 cycle, and the most seats flipped by Democrats in a generation. Nearly 1,250 of the Democrats elected to their state legislatures in 2018 were women, and more than 900 were candidates of color. 

As the only organization exclusively committed to electing Democrats to state legislatures all over the country, the DLCC has been working with state legislative leaders for over two decades to invest strategically in state programs and build the Democratic Party from the ground up.
