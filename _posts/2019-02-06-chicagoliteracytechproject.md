The Chicago Citywide Literacy Coalition (CCLC or the Coalition) helps Chicago’s Adult Education organizations secure resources and training so that underserved adult learners can become economically successful.

The Coalition provides technical assistance, grants, and professional development to more than 40 adult education organizations in the Chicago area each year. In addition to these services, the Coalition advocates to preserve and expand adult education programs in Chicago. Our focus is on ensuring that adults with low skills in Illinois can access programs and meet their personal and professional goals.

We are hiring an experienced Technology Project Manager who will manage CCLC’s portfolio of technology-related programs. The portfolio includes programs and services designed to increase adult educators’ use of technology in their classrooms.
