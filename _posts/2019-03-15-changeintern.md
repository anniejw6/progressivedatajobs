Change Research provides fast, affordable, and accurate technology-based polling to forward-thinking campaigns and causes across the country.  Whereas most public-opinion research firms will only work with a handful of clients in a few races around the country, in 2017 and 2018 Change Research interviewed over a million voters through its online platform and worked with hundreds of campaigns.  We are a combination of data scientists, technologists, veteran politicos, and activists drawn together by a passion to improve our Democracy by modernizing polling techniques and data so that great candidates and causes win in 2019, 2020, and beyond.
As a Summer Intern on the Data Science Team, you’d be involved in all aspects of our analytics, quantitative research, model development, and data pipeline. On any given day, you might be working with our staff to build a model to find swing voters, cleaning data for our political team’s analysis, or querying our database to understand a data pattern.
