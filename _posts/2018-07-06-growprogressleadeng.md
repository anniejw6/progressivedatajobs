Grow Progress is hiring a software engineer to build cutting-edge persuasion technology for social good.
We’re looking for someone who wants to be part of a team that’s pioneering an evidence-based approach to persuasion -- and who’s excited to build it from the ground up.
If you’re looking to make a big social impact and grow your skill set by architecting our tech stack, this might be the job for you.

Who We Are
Grow Progress is working with the latest persuasion science to create messaging that is frequently 100% to 500% more effective than existing ads -- and we’re using this tech to super-power campaigns, causes, and companies that make the world a better place.
We’re a fast-growing early stage startup backed by Higher Ground Labs. We have fantastic investors, strong early revenue, and more customers than we can currently handle -- that’s where you come in. We’re advised by a world-class group of experts, including Michael Slaby (Obama campaign CTO), Cindy Mottershead (CTO of Attentive.ly) and Chirag Patel (CTO of Apploi).
We’re a team of experienced campaigners and data scientists who are obsessed with harnessing the power of evidence to make organizations more effective. We’re ambitious, efficient, low-ego, and we like to make each other laugh.

Who We’re Looking For
You can move quickly to develop and test new features. As our lead engineer, you’ll define and improve our tech stack, so we’re looking for someone who’s scrappy and self-driven. We’d also like to work with someone who’s excited about learning new technologies and is good at communicating with both technical and non-technical teammates.

As part of our team, you will:
Write software to make it easier, faster, and cheaper for our team and our customers to design, run, and analyze randomized controlled experiments
Set up pipelines to store and clean our data
Build web applications to process and visualize our experiment results
Figure out how to break down the next steps on our roadmap into discrete, shippable features

More About Grow Progress
Our culture is fun, fast-paced, and focused on evidence. We aim to cultivate an environment where data drives our decisions rather than just anecdotes, and where everyone feels comfortable contributing ideas -- even if it’s on a topic outside of their expertise. We work hard to get smarter together by giving each other feedback that’s direct, actionable, and respectful. We’re deeply motivated by the work we do and committed to using this technology ethically, so we’re looking for teammates who feel the same way.
We’re also committed to building a diverse company. We’re an equal opportunity employer, so qualified people of all races, ethnicities, cultures, ages, sex, genders, sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, languages, social class, marital status, religions, veteran status, and disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.

Apply at the link below by July 13th.
