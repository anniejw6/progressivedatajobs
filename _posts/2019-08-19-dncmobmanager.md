Mobilization Analytics Project Manager

The Democratic National Committee is looking to hire a Mobilization Analytics Project Manager to help run one of the largest and most active grassroots mobilization programs in politics. We communicate with constituencies using email, direct mail, online ads, social media, SMS, phone calls and more. You will be responsible for project managing the efforts to clean up our party’s grassroots fundraising and organizing data, so we can optimize and personalize supporters’ interactions with our party. You will need to keep projects on the rails and on time -- and identify opportunities to improve our program and make an impact.
