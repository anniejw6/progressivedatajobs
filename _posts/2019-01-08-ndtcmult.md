The National Democratic Training Committee aims to empower any Democrat who wants to be involved in local politics with the tools needed to be successful. We offer free, interactive online and live training for Democratic candidates, their staff, and leaders within county Democratic parties.
We believe that by supporting these groups we can accomplish three goals: improve the performance of every Democrat up and down the ticket, elect more Democrats to office, and create a deeper bench of qualified candidates for higher office. In 2018, NDTC trained more than 160 candidates who won offices at every level from School Board to U.S. Congress.

* [Software Development Engineer](https://www.traindemocrats.org/software-development-engineer)

As well as other general positions such as
