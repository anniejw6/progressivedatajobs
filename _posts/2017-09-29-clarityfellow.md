Clarity Campaigns is hiring paid fellowships
[Job description here](http://www.claritycampaigns.com/careers/#careers/fellowships)
	
We are hiring current college students and recent graduates to join the Clarity team in Washington, D.C. for the summer (spring and fall may also be available). If you have strong analysis and technical skills and are interested in working on predictive models and analytical puzzles for high profile campaigns, you’re in the right place! Our ideal candidate is eager to learn, quick to pick up new skills, and dedicated to progressive candidates and causes.

In their time at Clarity, an analyst fellow will master the basics of political data, become fluent in campaign applications of analytics, gain valuable campaign experience, and develop the technical skills to tackle a wide range of analytic problems. We’re committed to paying our fellows, and compensation is based on experience. Fellowships also include the potential for full time employment upon graduation.
