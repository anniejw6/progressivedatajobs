Code for America builds technology to help government services work for the people who need them most.
We’re excited to launch our 2019 apprenticeship program cohort to provide a pathway for people early in their technical careers to get on the job training.  We’re looking for passionate mission driven folks who are looking for opportunities to grow their skills. The program is eight months, full-time, and paid, beginning in April 2019.

The application period for this apprenticeship program is January 14th - February 11th, 2019.

You may be a fit for this program if:

You’ve recently graduated from a degree or bootcamp program
You’re returning to the workforce and want to get up-to-date on your tech skills
You’re early in your career and looking to gain more experience
Our ideal apprentice has a solid technical foundation, is action-oriented and eager to learn, and shares our passion for the Code for America mission and our focus on helping users. We work with well-known and reliable technologies like Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, but we don’t require prior expertise in our stack. You’ll learn to confidently develop and ship software in our environment as you progress through your apprenticeship.
