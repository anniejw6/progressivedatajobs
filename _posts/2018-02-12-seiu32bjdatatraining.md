With 163,000 members in eleven states and Washington, D.C., 32BJ SEIU is the largest union representing property service workers in the country.

We are committed to engaging our diverse membership and to developing members to lead in our organizing, political, social justice and contract campaigns.

We seek a data training specialist to support all of 32BJ’s geographies.
