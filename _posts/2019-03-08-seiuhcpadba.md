SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania unites 45,000 nurses and healthcare workers across the continuum of care.  We are the nurses, professional and technical employees, direct care and service workers who work in Pennsylvaniaâ€™s hospitals, nursing homes, home and community based care services, and state health facilities. Together, we work to unite all nurses and healthcare workers, organize at work and in the community, drive public policy and legislation, and build a broad, strong movement for good jobs, quality care, and healthy communities across Pennsylvania.

The Database Administrator is a critical member of our Data & Analytics Team who maintains and improves our membership database, works with office staff and the Data & Analytics Director on key union functions such as processing member lists to update our systems, dues procedures/analysis, and continuing to innovate new ways to increase efficiencies and utilize new technology to make our lists cleaner, and our data better.v
