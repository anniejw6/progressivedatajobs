Greenpeace is a global, independent campaigning organization that uses peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future. For over fifty years, Greenpeace has fought to save the planet from the threat of global warming, destruction of ancient forests, deterioration of our oceans, and the threat of a nuclear disaster loom large. As an independent organization, Greenpeace does not accept funds from any corporations or government entities. Greenpeace is headquartered in the Netherlands, with offices all around the world in over fifty countries.

We’re hiring a Data Visualization Specialist to join the Greenpeace USA Digital team as we engage supporters in a people powered model of advocacy. This role will bring analytical rigor to challenges such as measuring the impact of an email test, optimizing donor retention, optimizing cross-platform channels of constituent growth and building models of donor behavior. The Data Visualization Specialist will take data and use it to help Greenpeace make better campaign, fundraising and engagement decisions. It’s a great opportunity to work with an amazing team of professionals and implement the online strategy of one of the largest and most effective environmental organizations in the world.

Are you a professional with substantial skill and experience working with data (SQL/ MySQL, Google Analytics) and the tools (HTML/CSS/ dashboards such as Google Data Studio) to visualize it? If so, this might be the job for you. This role will require an understanding of engagement and how to drive Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across the organization. We want an omnivorous mind with a talent for transforming complex subjects into simple yet striking visuals that communicate findings, including creating dashboards and presentations that upper management can consult at will that tell their own data stories.

Our ideal candidate has a passion for writing and illustrating data-driven visual stories. They love data and are able to coherently speak “data” to others. In addition to having profound information design and storytelling abilities, they are resourceful, confident under pressure, and comfortable working in a fast-paced, growth-oriented environment. We expect you would both pitch and execute ideas.

This role is exempt, full time role based in Washington, DC; or San Francisco, CA, and will report to the Director of Business Intelligence based in DC, with a dotted line to the Deputy Digital Director.
