Empower Engine is a small political technology firm. We aim to make data more accessible and approachable to our users, and we focus on map-based data visualization tools. We know that a picture is worth a thousand words; since we organize geographically, that picture should be a map. We are proudly partisan and consider ourselves to be the mapping toolset for the Democrats and their allies on the political left.

Empower Engine is an all-remote company. This job will be a combination of sales, marketing, and communications. As with any company of its size, employees should be ready to take on a wide variety of challenges. The ideal candidate will be in Washington DC, but applicants elsewhere in the US will be considered if their existing network is large enough.

Salary
Pay will be a combination of base salary, sales commissions, and revenue sharing. If the hire is successful, they
could earn partial ownership in a few years.
Base Salary: $40-60k
Expected Annual Take-home: $75-135k
