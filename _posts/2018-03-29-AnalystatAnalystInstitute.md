Analytics is at the heart of Analyst Institute's work (perhaps unsurprisingly), and we are looking for Analysts to join our team for the 2018 election cycle. You'll be part of a close-knit and capable team, partnering with key campaigns and organizations to apply your love of data, politics, and advocacy to some of the biggest questions in progressive politics. Your co-workers and the organizations you partner with will be among the best in the business. 

As an analyst, you can expect to:
* Prepare and analyze experiments that directly measure the effectiveness of real-world programs
* Monitor implementation data of experiments and programs as they are run
* Create visualizations of experimental results
* Occasionally data munge and clean using R and/or SQL
* Contribute to the maintenance of Analyst Institute’s collaborative codebase
* Draw from 10 years of past experimental results to create broad lessons for the progressive community

If you're passionate about data, statistics, and technology, and if you believe political organizing and activism can enact positive change, we want to work with you.

You will be a good fit for this role if:
* You are passionate about progressive politics
* You have worked with data and statistics using R (on a personal project, in academic research, or in a professional capacity)
* You are familiar with the concepts behind experimental design and causal inference
* You are organized, with a demonstrated ability to juggle complex projects with tight deadlines; at any given time, analysts may be contributing to as many as 5 to 10 projects
* You enjoy working collaboratively
* You quickly pick up new skills with minimal guidance

Additional experiences that are not required, but may help you succeed in this job:
* You are an expert R user; for example, you have created your own packages or contributed to open-source packages before
* You are familiar with a programming/scripting language such as Python
* You have used Github before for version control
* You have experience working on the command line on Linux or Unix systems
* You are comfortable with SQL, such as executing basic queries
* You are familiar with survey methodology and polling
* You are familiar with predictive analytics and machine learning techniques
* You have crafted client-ready deliverables in a professional setting
* You have worked in progressive data and analytics before with the Catalist, TargetSmart, or DNC voter and census data files

This role has no formal education requirements – we value demonstrated ability over educational background.

Analyst Institute values diversity in thought, background and experience, and we’re an equal opportunity employer. People of color, people with disabilities, women or non-binary candidates, and LGBTQIA candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.

Dates of employment: This is a temporary position for the 2018 election cycle, with employment through mid-November 2018. Te role may be able to convert into a long-term position after the election depending on performance and capacity.

Benefits: We offer fully-paid-for-health care, 15 days of annual paid vacation plus holidays, and unlimited sick leave.

Application process: Resumes will be accepted through April 20, 2018 and reviewed on a rolling basis.
