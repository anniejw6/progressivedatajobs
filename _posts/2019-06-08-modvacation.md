You didn't know a website could go on vacation? Well it's true, a laptop free vacation is happening and this is a site run by volunteer power. We also review each job listing before posting to make sure it fits the scope of this site. You can [read more on the About page](https://www.progressivedatajobs.org/about/).
The page will be up and running again around June 20th and we'll be sure to back post any jobs from the previous couple weeks. In the meantime, remember to check out the [Guide to getting a job in analytics](https://www.guide.progressivedatajobs.org/) or check out some of the [other resources for jobs](https://www.progressivedatajobs.org/resources/) including other job pages.
And last but not least, if you or someone you know had success finding a job lately, [fill out our short survey] and tell us about the experience(https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHzjmG1CiAPcHb_UPOHkewAP0wqG765bR5yOdhxabgKkSRhQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)!
