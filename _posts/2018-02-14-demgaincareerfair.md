“How can I do my part to change our country’s direction?”

This is the question that seems to pop up most often in the last year, culminating in a whopper of a December.  Here is how – help fight for change as a full-time job.  
Whether you have just volunteered or have been working in progressive politics for years, your skills are more in demand than ever.  With all the campaigns and groups fighting for progress in 2018 and beyond, they need the best staff they can recruit.
That is where we come in. GAIN's career fair is THE place where mission driven employers and potential employees can meet and learn more about each other.
We want to invite you to the Democratic GAIN 2018 Winter Career Fair on Friday, March 2nd, at the National Education Association in Washington DC.   
Democratic campaigns need you. Progressive groups need you. Consultants to these efforts need you. America needs you.  Make your next career step one that melds your work goals with your values.  We have the opportunities for you.
