Data Science at Alloy
At Alloy we are looking for data scientists at various levels of experience. Their main responsibility is data quality in the Alloy infrastructure and its first-party products.  This will require developing quantitative metrics to compare coverage and accuracy of diverse data sources. You will need to be familiar with statistical and probabilistic techniques for matching incomplete data sets and resolving conflicts, and will need to be able to conduct analyses into the hundreds of millions of rows, using Python or R.  You will need a strong grasp of experiment design and evidence-based methods of inference. You will sometimes be asked to help Alloy customers with upstream data quality issues, and will need consulting skills such as careful listening and constructive feedback. There is room to build a multidisciplinary team within the data science team, with specialized methodologists and data science generalists. A background in political data is always a plus, but not a requirement for these positions, since we want to draw experience from a diverse set of industries and backgrounds.  We are happy to hire great candidates that are strong in some of these skills and ready to learn others.


Inclusive Hiring Practices

Alloy values diverse team composition and an inclusive work environment.  We provide general descriptions of our job requirements to be helpful, but individual roles will vary and we encourage all candidates to apply if they meet a significant number of our requested qualifications.  It is not necessary that your resume check every box, as long as you are willing to learn.

Benefits

Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision care paid for by Alloy. We cover 100% of many health plans for employees and heavily subsidize family plans.
Fully paid parental leave of up to 18 weeks.
20 vacation days each year starting on your first day as an Alloy employee, plus 10 Federal holidays.
A sick time policy for your physical and mental well-being as well as that of your loved ones that doesn't take away from your vacation days
401k (Coming Soon!)
Non-Profit

Alloy is a taxable non-profit technology corporation with offices in Washington, DC and San Francisco, CA. This means that we donâ€™t have shareholders to return profits to -- but we do aim to offer salaries competitive with for-profit companies. You may want to know, however, that we are a DC non-profit, and not a 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 federal non-profit, and are not eligible for the programs those federal non-profit organizations enjoy.


Salary: Not listed

Location: Washington DC or San Francisco, CA
