Organization Background

Ingenuity was founded in 2011 to increase arts education access, quality and equity in Chicago
Public Schools (CPS), the country’s third-largest school district. Our mission is to ensure that every
child, in every grade, in every CPS school has access to a high-quality arts education. We are
passionate supporters of, and believers in, the power of arts education to transform the lives of
students in our public schools. In partnership with CPS leaders and schools, and Chicago’s vibrant
community of museums, cultural institutions and community-based arts organizations, Ingenuity
is driving systemic change in CPS arts education through four interconnected strategies: data,
professional learning, advocacy, and grant-making.

A large part of Ingenuity’s recent work has centered around the buildout of artlook®, a web
platform that unifies data from district operations, community agencies, and individual schools to
track growth across schools and time. After serving as a springboard to exponential gains in
Chicago Public Schools, Ingenuity is now working with state and national partners to bring
artlook® to communities nationwide. Learn more at artlookmap.com.

Data & Product Associate

Ingenuity is looking to fill a Data & Product Associate position to support its rapid expansion of
artlook within Chicago and beyond. The ideal candidate will be detail-oriented, possess strong
analytical skills, and be excited about advancing equity and access in public education through a
data-driven approach.

The Data & Product Associate is a member of Ingenuity’s Data & Research team and reports to the
Director of Data & Research. This position is responsible for carrying out work in two distinct but
interrelated areas: (1) data collection, analysis, and reporting and (2) artlook platform
development.

Data Collection, Analysis, and Reporting

The Data & Product Associate supports data collection through artlook® by compiling
administrative datasets from school districts and implementing strategies to increase engagement
in artlook’s data collection tools. Additional data management responsibilities include cleaning,
tracking, and updating data; compiling data for analysis; and maintaining technical documentation.
The Data & Product Associate carries out analyses and produces compelling visualizations to
support key artlook® users, including funders, policymakers, district administrators, and more. The
Data & Product Associate also produces data insights that inform and support strategic initiatives
internal to Ingenuity. For a few examples of typical analytical and reporting projects, visit

artlook® platform development

The Data & Product Associate plays a critical role in the success of artlook by ensuring the
platform is built to address the individual needs of users. The person in this role must therefore
strive to understand the artlook® platform—and the data collected through the platform—inside
and out. The Data & Product Associate writes technical requirements for new artlook® features,
finds and reports bugs, and conceptualizes future development opportunities in line with trends in
the education technology sector. The ideal candidate does not necessarily need formal training or
experience in software development or information systems to carry out these tasks successfully,
but intellectual curiosity and a passion for using technology to improve access and equity in public
education are essential.

A successful candidate will be a detail-oriented, strategic thinker who is eager to learn new skills
and able to mix abstract reasoning with pragmatic implementation, clearly articulate analytical
findings, and field questions with ease. You’ll be able to converse in “data speak” to research
experts and also translate key data-related ideas to non-data-experts. Additionally, the Data &
Product Associate will need to be comfortable presenting findings and discussing Ingenuity’s data
work in front of varying audiences.
Note that Ingenuity conducts its analyses using R (https://www.r-project.org/). The successful
candidate must be experienced using R or a similar tool and/or must be excited about learning to
code and operate in this environment.

Priority Skills and Experience:

* Strong project management skills: determining the appropriate processes, workflows, and
timelines to accomplish projects, and meeting deadlines without issue.
* Highly skilled using data science software such as R, Python, or Stata and willingness to
work in R.
* Able to synthesize and analyze data from a variety of sources, to interpret research and
educate stakeholders about emerging findings and issues, and to understand and
communicate the limitations of data and research.
* Can maintain a positive attitude and work effectively with diverse populations while
leading projects that involve numerous tasks and multiple teams.
* Able to work independently with little supervision and see a work product through from
start to finish.
* A creative, critical thinker and problem solver with an ability to prioritize.
* Effective public presentation skills, including the ability to simplify complex topics for
presentations to teachers, arts partners, funders, and other audiences.

Desired Background:

* Bachelor’s degree or equivalent work experience required.
* At least 2 years’ experience coding in R, Python, Stata, or other statistical analysis program
preferable; demonstrated interest in coding / learning to code a must.
* Advanced education in data science, public policy, education policy, arts administration, or
business administration desired.
* Exceptional, effective and persuasive written and oral communications skills.
* Applicants should be legally authorized to work in the United States.
