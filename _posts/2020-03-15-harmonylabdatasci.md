Harmony Labs builds communities and tools to reform and transform media systems. Our
mission is to create a world where media systems support healthy, democratic culture and
healthy, happy people. We’re organizing partners and publics to identify and gain consensus on
the mechanics of media influence, and the values and design principles that underlie beneficial
media. And, we’re building solid, sustainable interventions and innovations that start moving us
in the direction of media that can serve the public good.
We’re looking for someone eager to learn how to make big data work for good. If you are that
person, you will live in New York City, Washington DC, or Florida’s Tampa Bay area.
You will have a background in a quantitative or social science field and programming skills. (We
use R and Python here.) You will have at least three years of professional experience working on
a team that includes both technical experts and experts in another field such as
communications. And you will be passionate about translating big, messy data into products
that are actually useful to people making decisions or making art.


The DATA SCIENTIST will take on the following roles and responsibilities:
* Design and test annotation schemes for language classifiers
* Analyze media consumption data for key insights
* Help researchers outside Harmony use our data for their projects
* Create reports based on the data

It would also be cool if you:
* Have worked with big data before
* Have experience with Natural Language Processing


Salary:  $70-100K. 

Location: New York City, Washington DC, or Tampa Bay, FL
