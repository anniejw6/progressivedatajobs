What is Crack the Code?

Crack the Code is a conference to promote the personal and professional growth of women and genderqueer people who work in progressive data, analytics, and technology. Crack the Code is a trans-friendly space. Crack the Code 2018 will take place on Saturday, March 17th, 2018 in New York City. This year, we’re focusing on how people can personally and professionally advance in the space. That means we’re putting a bigger emphasis on managing up, down, and sideways; learning new skills in your role; and pairing attendees with experts on resume and cover letter writing, negotiation, and more.
[Read more about the conference here](https://crackthecode.io/) The conference is free to attend.
