We donâ€™t just collect data, we connect data. YouGov is an international data and analytics group with the ambition to become a unique part of the global internet infrastructure - like Google for search, Facebook for social, Amazon for retail, we want it to be YouGov for opinion. Our value chain is a virtuous circle consisting of a highly engaged online panel, innovative data collection methods and powerful analytics technology. From the beginning, we had one simple idea: the more people are able to participate in the decisions made by the institutions that serve them, the better those decisions will be. We are a global online community for millions of people, and thousands of organisations, to engage in a continuous conversation about their beliefs, behaviours and brands, and provide a more accurate portrait of what the world thinks.

YouGov operates an online panel of over 6 million panellists across 38 countries. These represent all ages, socio-economic groups and other demographic types which allows us to create nationally representative online samples and access hard to reach groups, both consumer and professional.

As part of the YouGov Panel team, you will support in ensuring that the YouGov panel is capable of meeting current and future business needs, offering an excellent user experience to panellists, and providing unparalleled feasibility, panel pricing, sampling and fieldwork service to internal clients.
