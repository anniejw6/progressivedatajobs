Change Research is hiring a Data Engineer and a Survey Data Analyst.

Change Research is revolutionizing polling -- making it fast, affordable, and accurate for forward-looking candidates and causes. We reduce polling costs by up to 90% by bringing everything online, recruit a representative on the fly with a new approach to targeted advertising, and automating most of the process of analyzing survey data.  That means we can provide results in 1-4 days rather than 10-14, charge $3-5K rather than $20-40K, and deliver accurate insights about public opinion.  We publicly shared insights on transgender soldiers twelve hours after Trump's infamous tweet and were spot on in the Montana special election. And as we grow, we'll have more deep data about the electorate than anyone (okay, anyone except Facebook).
