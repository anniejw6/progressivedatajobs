IFF improves the world by strengthening nonprofits and the communities they serve. As a mission-driven lender, real estate consultant, and developer, IFF helps communities thrive by creating opportunities for low-income communities and persons with disabilities. Key to our success has been a deep sense of purpose, a broad perspective, and a relentless focus on achieving positive results. Across the Midwest, we help clients from every sector, including human service agencies, health centers, schools, affordable housing developers, and grocery stores. Staff contributes its extensive business experience with an unrivaled connection to the mission of IFF and the nonprofit clients it serves.

IFF is looking for candidates with a commitment to the work it does and can demonstrate their creativity, detail-orientation, diligence, efficiency, enthusiasm, flexibility, organization, thoughtfulness, and sense of humor. Our staff of nearly 100 professionals works from our Chicago headquarters, and we also serve the Midwest from six regional offices: Indianapolis, IN; Detroit, MI; Kansas City, MO; St. Louis, MO; Columbus, OH; and Milwaukee, WI. The job in a nutshell As part of its latest strategic plan, in 2018 IFF has started a massive “renovation” of our data management systems and processes, bringing our data infrastructure into the 21st century and most importantly ensuring that data enables our work in increasingly strategic and efficient ways. As part of this renovation, we seek an experienced data architect who will be IFF’s first dedicated data architect and own the continuous evolution of IFF’s data infrastructure. We prefer for this role to be based in Chicago but are open to other Midwest locations for the right candidate.
