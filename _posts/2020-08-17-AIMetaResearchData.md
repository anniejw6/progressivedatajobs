Analyst Institute is looking to fill two full-time roles of Meta-Analysis Research Manager and Meta-Analysis Data Scientist on the Research Team as soon as possible. You'll be part of a close-knit, cutting edge team of experts with backgrounds in social, behavioral, and data science. We will accept and review applications on a rolling basis. We strongly encourage applicants to apply by August 31st and will give priority to applications submitted by that date.

The Team

Over the past two decades, the progressive, civic engagement, and academic communities have conducted hundreds of randomized controlled field experiments to determine the efficacy and cost-efficiency of various approaches to voter mobilization and persuasion. These experiments have evaluated the impact of voter contact programs across a wide variety of electoral, temporal, and geographic contexts. As part of the research team at Analyst Institute, the meta-analysis team uses statistics to combine these studies to learn even more about the impact of voter contact programs.

The Roles

The Meta-Analysis Research Manager will serve as the principal investigator on our ambitious meta-analysis project, leading a team to regularly update and expand one of the organization’s flagship research projects. The Meta-Analysis Research Manager will be responsible for the design, implementation, and reporting on this multi-faceted, long-term project that offers insights into a wide variety of subjects: get-out-the-vote efforts, voter registration, candidate and issue persuasion, electoral salience, voter contact in communities of color, and more. If you are a strong project manager with a deep understanding of quantitative research design and can talk fluently with practitioners, this could be a great role for you.

The Meta-Analysis Data Scientist will serve as a methodological expert on our ambitious meta-analysis project, leading the statistical development of one of the organization’s most innovative research projects. The Meta-Analysis Data Scientist will be responsible for the design and validation of the statistical models underpinning this multi-faceted, long-term project that addresses a wide variety of analytical subjects: meta-regression, heterogeneity, predictive modeling, and more. If you are a strong methodologist with a thirst to tackle challenging research questions and have real world impact, this could be a great role for you.

At Analyst Institute, you will get exposure to people and research across the progressive movement, serve as the bridge between sophisticated social science research and practical take-aways for folks working on the ground, and collaborate with amazing people. You will be a prominent player in the progressive world, and we will invest in your skills and professional development. 

Interested candidates may apply for either or both roles. If you are not sure whether to apply as a Research Manager or Data Scientist, please make your best judgement and we will follow up if necessary.

* Is detail-oriented and driven to get things right; we have a hard-earned reputation for doing rigorous work.
* Has advanced knowledge of causal inference and methods of social scientific measurement.
* Is an independent problem-solver with good intuitions about when to ask for help.

Though not required, for either the Research Manager or Data Scientist role, please note if your skills and experience include:
* Familiarity with social science research on persuasion, voter mobilization, or other relevant topics.
* Experience working with communities of color and other underrepresented groups or experience studying racial and ethnic politics.

For the Research Manager role, you should also be someone who:
* Is adept at internal and external stakeholder engagement across all stages of a research project.
* Has strong project management skills, including timeline development and management skills as well as an ability to effectively organize project work; particularly for long-term, complex, quantitative research projects.
* Can effectively manage a small team, including providing day-to-day oversight on project implementation, ensuring coordination across multiple workflows, and building a collaborative team environment.
* Has strong written and verbal communication skills, being able to effectively synthesize a large amount of information and communicate with diverse audiences including data scientists and progressive practitioners.


Though not required, for the Research Manager role, please note if your skills and experience include:
* A methodological understanding of randomized controlled experiments, especially field experiments, or meta-analysis research.
* Experience working or volunteering with political campaigns, community based-organizations or other progressive groups or similar organizations.
* Comfort with running meetings and delivering presentations.
* Familiarity with voter files, survey data or other political data (e.g., precinct level election data, volunteer or member data, political contribution data, etc.).
* Experience with the procedures and systems used in large-scale data collection and management, including cleaning and validating messy data.
* Experience with statistics software, preferably R or Python; other statistical programming languages acceptable.
* Experience working with a wide variety of digital communication technologies (e.g., Slack, Asana, etc.) to facilitate project management and collaboration.

For the Data Scientist role, you should be someone who:
* Has experience conducting or strong familiarity with meta-analytic techniques using aggregated or individual data.
* Has experience developing and validating predictive models, response models, or heterogeneous treatment effect models, including addressing modeling issues such as: heteroskedasticity, overidentification, bias/variance trade-off adjustments.
* Is up to speed and willing to stay current on the latest work in quantitative political methodology, statistics, causal inference and related fields.
* Has expertise in statistics software - preferably R or Python - including the ability to develop packages, write custom functions, and work collaboratively using version control software like Git.
* Is familiar with the procedures and systems used in large-scale data collection and management, including cleaning and validating messy data.
* Has project management skills, including scope and timeline management skills; particularly for complex, quantitative research projects.
* Has experience with scientific communication, translating technical concepts to non-technical audiences.

Though not required, for the Data Scientist role, please note if your skills and experience also include:
* Experience implementing a range of causal inference methodologies, including experimental designs (e.g. randomized controlled trials, field experiments, factorial or conjoint experiments) and non-experimental designs (e.g. regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, matching).
* Experience with multilevel modeling, machine learning, network analysis, Bayesian statistics, or natural language processing.
* Technical skills including utilizing relational databases with SQL and accessing storage buckets like Amazon S3.
* Experience working with voter files, survey data or other political data (e.g., precinct level election data, volunteer or member data, political contribution data, etc.).
