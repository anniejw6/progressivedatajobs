The Director of the AFL-CIO Data, Analytics and Infrastructure Resource Department is responsible for leading the work of the entire department (a team of 20+ people) and representing the department internally and with external partners, including affiliate unions, state federations and central labor councils, partner organizations and allies. You will not be managing the day-to-day operations of the team. Instead, you will focus on being a strong advocate for the AFL-CIO as well as building and developing long-term goals for the department.

We are looking for someone committed to building power for the labor movement through technology. We understand the importance that organizing and deep member engagement plays in making labor stronger and you should too. You should be able to navigate competing priorities from multiple partners, be committed to running a program based in an analytical and data grounded mindset, and have a background in data, analytics, digital, web development or other technical field. You should also be comfortable explaining complex ideas to non-technical people and be a skilled presenter.

The Data, Analytics & Infrastructure Resource Department’s goal is to generate lasting power for the labor movement, by building the Federation's programmatic tools, web development, data systems, and analytics capacity. We serve a broad range of partners across the labor movement--from other AFL-CIO departments, to AFL-CIO affiliates, to state and local labor bodies. By investing in our central infrastructure, training, and direct service work, we aim to empower the AFL-CIO’s partners to run stronger and more cost effective campaigns.
