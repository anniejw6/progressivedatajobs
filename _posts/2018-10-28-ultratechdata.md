UltraViolet is a national organization that drives feminist cultural and political change. Through people power and strategic advocacy, we work to improve the lives of women and girls of all identities and backgrounds, and all people impacted by sexism, by dismantling discrimination and creating a cost for sexism. We work on a range of interconnected issues, including violence against women, economic security, reproductive rights, racial justice, and immigration, that impact the lives of women.
UltraViolet's one million members have taken down major misogynists — from Bill O'Reilly and Harvey Weinstein to Roger Ailes and Rick Ross; organized nationwide to save the Affordable Care Act; campaigned for justice for women of color treated brutally by law enforcement; forced Yahoo to stop promoting fake anti-abortion clinics; and more.
Right now, UltraViolet is focused on mobilizing for the upcoming election by exposing Republicans in Congress who have the worst track record on women’s issues and lifting up trailblazing women candidates.

UltraViolet is an organization run by women, immigrants, people of color, indigenous women, and LGBTQ+ people. Sexism disparately impacts us and we strongly encourage people from these and other impacted communities to apply.
