The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is the nation's most effective environmental action organization. We use law, science and the support of 3.1 million members and online activists to protect the planet's wildlife and wild places and to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all living things. NRDC was founded in 1970 and our staff helped write some of America's bedrock environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act, and many of the implementing regulations; our water enforcement cases played a major role shaping current water policy throughout the country. Today, our staff of more than 500 lawyers, scientists, economists, policy and communications experts, and others, work out of offices in New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Bozeman, Montana, and Beijing.

Position Summary:

NRDC’s newly launched Analytics Team focuses upon learning how to better mobilize and inspire our activists, donors, supporters and audiences to take action for a clean and healthy environment, then translates those findings into actionable strategies for our colleagues who manage our campaigns and outreach efforts. The Analytics Team seeks an Email and Web Analyst to carry out our analytics efforts to inform our email outreach, website/UX and mobile advocacy approaches, and to collaborate with our Content Marketing Director on analyzing our editorial, marketing and campaigns content. The Email and Web Analyst will play a leading role in helping us validate and implement new data-driven ways of engaging our supporters online. This Analyst will work closely with two other Analysts and a Content Marketing Director, and it will report to the Director of Analytics. This is currently a term limited position which is expected to continue through June 2020.
