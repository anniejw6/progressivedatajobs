The ACLU is seeking a full-time Data Reporting Analyst focused on creating compelling reports and dashboard solutions alongside teams of Data Scientists, Data Engineers and business users to enable the use of innovative data-driven methods and advanced analytics to transform the way the nationwide organization approaches all facets of its mission, including advocacy, communications, and fundraising. This includes collaborating with stakeholders to define their reporting needs, building compelling self-service reporting assets, and working across the organization to improve our data literacy and reporting capabilities.

This role will have a particular focus on supporting our advocacy and fundraising goals through working with our membership data, polling, and voter files, to support and guide the work of our digital engagement, field organizing, and political advocacy teams. Experience from a political campaign data team a plus, but not required.

The Data Reporting Analyst will be the center of knowledge throughout the organization and will act as a champion for the many opportunities for business users to better understand ACLU data. The Data Reporting Analyst will work with the rest of the Data and Analytics team to play a leading role in designing the ACLUâ€™s reporting/BI infrastructure, building out reporting and visualization assets, and deploying solutions to help the ACLU identify meaningful insights, inform strategic decisions, and enhance modes of constituent engagement. The person in the role will join the Data & Analytics team in New York, led by the Chief Analytics Officer.
