WHO WE ARE / COMPANY OVERVIEW:

We Elect Democrats!

DigiDems was founded in 2018 to fill talent and technology gaps in Democratic politics in an effort to leverage the new technology created after the 2016 election and make campaigns more secure, efficient, and effective. The organization recruits and trains skilled technology talent and embeds them on Democratic campaigns. DigiDems now has a network of over 100 technologists that anchor a reliable pipeline of high-skilled tech talent that Democratic campaigns can deploy in election cycles.

In 2019, Blue Leadership Collaborative was founded to address the staff retention crisis on Democratic campaigns, and works to identify and retain high value campaign operatives, in particular women and people of color. The organization supports the next generation of campaign managers, and has a growing alumni network who continue to take on leadership roles on Democratic campaigns.

Under the parent organization, Zinc Collective, DigiDems and Blue Leadership Collaborative will continue to build the pipeline of Democratic campaign talent.
