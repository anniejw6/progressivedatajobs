Sunrise Movement is dedicated to stopping climate change and creating millions of good jobs in the process, by building an army of young people to make climate change an urgent priority across America, end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics, and elect leaders who stand up for the health and wellbeing of all people.  In November 2018, following our 6-month 75-person electoral organizing fellowship, Sunrise Semester, we launched the campaign for a Green New Deal alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2019, Sunrise has continued fighting for a Green New Deal and elevating the urgency of climate change in the public and the media. Sunrise Movement Education Fund (501c3) and Sunrise (501c4) are organizations dedicated to supporting the mobilization and leadership of Sunrise Movement.
