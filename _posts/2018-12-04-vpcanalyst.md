The Voter Participation Center is the leading 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to mobilizing the Rising American Electorate – unmarried women, people of color, and young people – in the fields of voter registration and GOTV mail. The Center for Voter Information is a progressive 501(c)(4) nonprofit that works to engage and
inform both the RAE as well as the broader electorate.

The Analyst will help develop and execute a strategic data-driven research program supporting VPC and CVI’s missions. Reporting to the Director of Analytics, the Analyst will be a key part of a small but ambitious analytics team and will be expected to contribute to all aspects of the analytics team’s work.
The Analyst will contribute to a range of data projects, including developing and managing databases, reporting, research, testing, and analysis. The Analyst should be able to communicate clearly and effectively and should be detail-oriented, flexible, and a self-directed problem solver.
A talented Analyst will help VPC and CVI expand their scope and increase their efficiency as their work continues to grow. Looking forward the analytics team will improve VPC and CVI’s data management, develop new tools for reporting and data visualization, evaluate existing predictive models, help build new predictive models, and conduct innovative research. Data is the foundation of everything VPC and CVI do and this is a great opportunity to contribute to innovative and important civic engagement work.
