The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee Data Department is accepting applications for our Fall 2018 Internship Program lasting from late August through December and located in Washington, DC.

The DLCC Internship Program is designed to provide hands-on experience working with a national political committee and its engagement in a 50-state program. Interns will gain an unprecedented understanding of state legislative caucus programs and campaigns.

The Data Department works closely with the Political Department in building a strong infrastructure for data-driven campaigns. Interns will assist the Data Department in all activities: from acquiring, cleaning, and processing data to building and automating reports. The data interns will also be tasked with monitoring election results and maintaining and updating state legislative election results database. Candidates with strong Microsoft Excel skills or SQL skills and experience working or volunteering on a political campaign are preferred.

Successful candidates will have the opportunity to do substantive work with the Data Department team while gaining a rich understanding of the DLCC and its mission. Interns will interact with staff members of all departments, attend key staff events, including professional development opportunities, and participate in brown bag lunches with varying senior staff members and key partners of the DLCC. Interns receive a weekly stipend.

Please submit a cover letter and resume to jobs@dlcc.org. Please reference “Fall 2018 Data Intern Application” and your name in the subject line. No calls please. Applicants will be screened on a rolling basis.
