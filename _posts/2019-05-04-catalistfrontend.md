Catalist is seeking to fill two full-time front-end engineering positions. One is more focused on PHP CMS work, the other on Javascript/React, but both have a significant degree of skill crossover on basic web development practices and technologies.  These are both entry-level to mid-level positions.  Company diversity is a strategic goal, and under-represented and non-traditional candidates are encouraged to apply.

Salary: Not Listed
