What to know

The Blue State fellowship is a 6-month program designed to give you the skills, mentorship and hands-on client experiences to pursue a career at a creative agency, nonprofit, or political campaign--or to join Blue State’s staff as an associate employee.  

As a fellow, you’ll develop expertise in a primary and a secondary focus area. This fellowship offers a primary focus in analytics, but you will also be able to pursue a complimentary secondary focus.

What to expect

Work with an inspiring mix of clients from advocacy groups to cultural institutions to big brands. As an Analytics Fellow, you will:
* Collect and analyze data to serve the needs of your client portfolio, including but not limited to: web traffic and user behavior, email messaging statistics, paid media performance, and social media trends.
* Maintain dashboards built in Google Sheets, Data Studio, and BigQuery.
* Learn to use CRMs like Every Action, Digital Tools, Luminate Online, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and Marketo to support colleagues and answer client questions.
* Transform your observations into insightful narratives and clear visualizations to inform the bigger strategy.
* Help develop persuasive presentations and memos demonstrating the value of our work for client teams.

What you’re looking for
* Purpose. Do meaningful work that matters. 
* Growth. Jumpstart your career at a place that rewards curiosity and creative thinking, and offers the possibility of growing into a full-time role.
* Mentorship. Work with mentors who are invested in your success, providing continuous feedback and helping you grow the way you want. 
* Diversity. Join a diverse, inclusive community made up of people from all walks of life and grounded in mutual respect, compassion, and learning.
* Versatility. Build up your skills in analytics while learning about a secondary area of focus.
* Teamwork. Become integrated into project teams from the start, working closely with and learning from teammates across disciplines — designers, developers, writers and many more.

The top things we're looking for
* You have a strong interest in analytics, information architecture, or data science. 
* You approach communication with empathy and respect. Teamwork and scrappiness required.
* A passion for cause-based work and promoting progressive values.
* Solid data analysis skills in Excel or Google Sheets. Experience with SQL, Python, or R preferred but not essential. 
* You manage your time well and are excited to dive into multiple projects at once.
* You’d like to learn more about marketing, fundraising, advocacy, or web development. 
* Some knowledge of statistical methods (significance testing, regression analysis, etc) preferred. If you’re interested but haven’t had the opportunity, we welcome those interested in learning as well!
