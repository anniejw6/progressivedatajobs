The Analytics Fellow will be reporting to one or both of the co-founders of Pantheon Analytics and will provide analytics and/or programming support to the team through the 2020 election period. The Analytics Fellow will work closely with our team to find creative solutions for the data problems our clients bring to us. Our work runs the gamut from building data pipelines and running fundraising reports to designing Vote By Mail experiments and analyzing Census data -- not to mention prepping for redistricting next year. As the Analytics Fellow, you will be in the thick of everything we do.

At Pantheon, we are constantly working with databases of voters, activists, and donors -- diverse populations where understanding the cultural and political context is vital. We value the input of individuals who come from different backgrounds. Your unique perspective will enhance the work. We strive to create a workplace that reflects the values of the progressive movement and strongly encourage diverse candidates to apply. Learn more about Pantheon at our website.

We are looking for someone who is smart and has some of the skills below, but we are flexible and willing to mold the fellowship to fit your strong suits. We encourage you to apply even if you only meet some of the “requirements”. On some projects the Fellow will serve as a supporting analyst, giving you an opportunity to learn from our team and grow your analytics skills in new directions. On other projects you will serve as a lead analyst, letting you flex your creative analytical skills and independent work ethic.

Whether through coursework, trainings, or job experience, Analytics Fellow candidates should have a background in programming, data science, statistics, or a related field.

* Take on independent data analysis and/or programming projects, depending on skill set
* Run weekly data reports for ongoing client projects

* Self motivated & strong remote-team communication skills
