For the last 16 years, the Voter Participation Center (VPC), a 501(c)(3) civic engagement organization, has led the way in recognizing and harnessing the potential power of the Rising American Electorate (RAE) – unmarried women, people of color, and young people – as a vital voting bloc. VPC has positioned itself as the leading experimental and scientific civic engagement organization by accumulating more than a decade’s worth of knowledge and experience in registering and turning out the new majority of eligible voters. VPC’s programs have consistently proven to be some of the most impactful and cost-effective—and to date VPC has registered almost 4 million Americans to vote. VPC continues to innovate with its approach and techniques to impact greater civic engagement, registration, and turnout.


The Center for Voter Information (CVI) is a separate but affiliated progressive 501(c)(4) nonprofit that works to engage and persuade both the RAE as well as the broader electorate.



Position Description:


The Director of Data and Analytics will manage and execute a strategic data-driven research program supporting VPC’s mission to increase the civic participation of historically underrepresented groups in our democracy. Managing a three-person and growing analytics team, the Director of Data and Analytics will be enthusiastic about research methods, randomized controlled experiments and innovations in data and technologies to be used in programs and assessments of results. This person will be adept at and have knowledge of advances in technology that can be applied to VPC and CVI programs. Strong skills in people management and project management are required. The successful candidate will possess strong organizational, communication, and problem-solving skills and have the ability to work independently and effectively in an action-oriented office. This is an excellent opportunity for an entrepreneurial, driven individual to play a leadership role in an organization poised to have a huge impact in the upcoming presidential election cycle.



Salary: $120,000 – $130,000
