The Movement Cooperative seeks a qualified Director of Research & Analytics to manage our research division, TMC Insights. An ideal candidate is committed to helping progressive organizations make sound decisions based on existing and original analyses. As an organization, TMC prioritizes equity in all aspects of our work and seeks to elevate the voices and experiences of marginalized individuals and communities. This is especially true in our research, as our highest priority is to fill gaps and contribute to the discourse around advocacy and movement building in ways that mainstream research consultancies do not.  

In this role, you will:

Create and execute a research agenda focused on equity & inclusion, prioritizing projects that will be most impactful for the progressive movement at large.
Work closely with the cooperative’s member organizations to design and execute research projects, including surveys and experiments, which seek to answer their most important research questions.
Manage a team of social scientists and data scientists, ensuring high-quality work, methodological rigor, and adherence to reasonable deadlines.
Develop relationships with vendors, negotiating for access to additional data resources and services that enhance the work of the cooperative.
Present our research to both internal and external stakeholders.
Be TMC’s representative at research conferences and other events.
Build statistical models to fill gaps and manage modeling pipelines and productization of our research.

Salary: 90k-115k dependent on experience.
