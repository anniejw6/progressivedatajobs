The Community Development Project (CDP) provides legal, participatory research and policy support to strengthen the
work of grassroots and community-based groups in New York City to dismantle racial, economic and social oppression.
CDP employs a unique model of partnership with grassroots and community-based groups. Our partners take the lead in
determining the priorities and goals for our work, and advance our understanding of justice. CDP’s current practice areas
are capacity building, consumer justice, equitable neighborhoods, tenants' rights & housing justice, immigrants' rights,
participatory research and policy, and workers’ rights.
CDP’s Research and Policy Initiative partners with and provides strategic support to grassroots community organizations
to build the power of their organizing and advocacy work. We utilize a “participatory action research” model in which
low-income and excluded communities are central to the design and development of research and policy. The Research
and Policy Coordinator would report to the Director of Research and Policy and join a team of three full-time staff within
a larger organization of about 60 people.

Job Description:

The Research and Policy Coordinator will manage and oversee the conceptualization, design, implementation, data
collection, data analysis, writing and dissemination of collaborative research and policy projects in partnership with
various community partners, under the direction of the Director of Research and Policy. Projects are rooted in the needs,
goals and objectives of CDP’s community partners and support our partners’ community organizing and advocacy efforts.
Projects cover a range of issues areas including (but not limited to): affordable housing; sustainable development; workers’
rights; immigrants’ rights, housing rights, LGBTQ rights, public health and criminal justice. This position requires
independent judgment and decision-making. In addition, the position will be required to participate in ongoing activities
of CDP including committees, fundraising and other day-to-day activities to help run the project. The position will require
you to work some weekend and evening hours.
