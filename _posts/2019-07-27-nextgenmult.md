NextGen is hiring for regional data directors and a data engineer! If you're passionate about the youth vote, expanding ballot access, messy voter registration data, and slightly unconventional tactics (have you seen the petting zoos and bounce houses on campuses?), reach out and apply! Next Gen is currently in 11 states (AZ, FL, IA, ME, MI, NC, NH, NV, PA, VA, WI) but headquartered in San Francisco. Preference is for these positions to be based in San Francisco but possibility to be remote.

NextGen America acts politically to prevent climate disaster, promote prosperity, and protect the fundamental rights of every American.  Since our founding as NextGen Climate in 2013, we’ve worked to fight climate change by advancing the transition to a clean energy economy. We’ve supported candidates who support climate action. We’ve fought to halt the Keystone XL pipeline and registered more than 1 million voters nationwide.  Now, the same values that drive our work on climate are under unprecedented attack from all directions. We’re proud to step up the fight for immigrant rights, affordable health care, prosperity, and equality.
