Are you interested in using data to fight for progressive causes in the United States and around the world? Work on the front lines of the #Resistance. Take your data skills to a renowned and established company. Be the first to see the latest campaign insider information. For over three decades, GQR has used sophisticated polling and opinion research to help leading candidates, parties, government leaders, corporations, and advocacy groups. We are currently looking for a hard worker with an interest in progressive politics and an aptitude for computer software to help program our surveys.

As a Research Data Associate at GQR, you will utilize software packages (similar to Stata) to create and process survey datasets and tabulate results. You will program, review, and text survey instruments and showcase your meticulous attention to detail in ensuring data accuracy.

This position is considered an election-year position and may not be needed after the November 2020 election season. In the event that business and performance levels warrant, we may extend employment or negotiate an end date in the fall of 2020.
