[Job description here](https://aflcio.hirecentric.com/jobs/124441.html).


The AFL-CIO builds unity across the labor movement to ensure all working people have the freedom to join together to negotiate a better life for themselves and their families. Our goal is to build power for all working people, and make every job a good job. We are ultimately accountable to 55 affiliated unions that represent over 12.5 million working people.

Our mission in the Data Infrastructure Department is to support this work. We aim to ensure that, as a labor movement, we’re running the strongest and most cost effective political and legislative mobilization, digital, and organizing campaigns that we possibly can. That takes a variety of forms: making central investments in tools and infrastructure to support many different kinds of users, direct service work, training, strategy consulting, etc. We serve a broad range of different clients across the labor movement.

The Lead Data Architect will:

Maintain and build on our data warehouse, the home for almost all of the AFL-CIO’s political and organizing data. Deploy data pipelines to integrate new sources of data into our central database.
Build reports and data visualizations, using data from the data warehouse and other sources.
Produce scalable, replicable code that helps automate repetitive data management tasks that other team members perform on a regular basis.
Perform one off data manipulation/munging and analysis on a wide variety of political and organizing data. Lots of running counts with SQL.

In practice, we’re looking for someone who is able to do the following:

Data manipulation/munging: read in data, process and clean it, transform and recode it, merge different data sets together, reformat data between wide and long, etc.
Write programming code that is well-documented and stored in a version control system.
Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) data into a relational database. Interact with large databases using SQL.
Build sequences of automated processes with Python or R.
Hit APIs to pull and push data from various data systems and platforms.
Advanced data visualization and mapping are helpful, but not essential.

If you're at all interested in applying, we urge you to begin the application process and submit your resume and cover letter to https://aflcio.hirecentric.com/jobs/124441.html by Tuesday, September 12. If you feel that you don't meet all of the qualifications, we'd encourage you to apply anyway. I also suggest reading Annie’s guide to work in progressive analytics, especially the section on programming: https://anniejw6.gitbooks.io/jobs-proganalytics/content/content/04a_program.html
