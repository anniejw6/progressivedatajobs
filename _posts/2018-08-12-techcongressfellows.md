About TechCongress
TechCongress is a three-year-old startup non-profit, incubated at the Open Technology Institute at New America. We've got great staff and advisors doing all we can to bridge the gap between government and the technology community. We are nonpartisan and work with a diverse set of political voices, and do not take positions on issues. We work hard in an intentional and productive manner, and have fun while we do it. We are building a new generation of technology leaders, and support our staff and fellows with professional development, networking, and freedom to tinker and test new ideas. Above all, we are vigilantly focused on adding value—to our people, our institutions and our society.

The first set of Congressional Innovation Fellows served with two of the most influential members of Congress—Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.), former Ranking Member on the House Committee on Ways and Means, and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), former Chairman of the House Oversight Committee—and shaped the conversation on issues ranging from modernizing healthcare with technology to the Apple/FBI encryption debate.
The second and thirds sets of Congressional Innovation Fellows have served in bipartisan placements in the Congress including with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York), Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colorado), Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), and Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky).  Congressional Innovation Fellows are tackling issues from the economic implications of emerging technologies like AI and automation to cybersecurity, election security and data privacy.  Please visit our fellows page for information about where all of our fellows are serving. 

As a Congressional Innovation Fellow you will:
* Work with TechCongress to choose a placement with a Member or Congress or Congressional Committee and report directly to a senior staffer (like a Chief of Staff or Staff Director) in that office from January 2019 to December 2019.
* Perform duties similar to other Congressional staff by applying your experience in technology to a variety of work, including:
* Researching relevant policymaking (on issues like encryption, autonomous vehicle regulations, health IT, government hacking, privacy, open data, cyber/data security and many others)
* Helping educate Members and staff about these issues.
* Researching legislation.
* Preparing for and organizing Committee hearings, markups, or investigations.
* Building coalitions with partners and other groups.
* Develop and produce a fellowship project on an issue of your choosing. Past projects include writing and introducing legislation, and organizing an association of tech staffers.
* Support TechCongress by writing about and presenting on your experience periodically, and represent TechCongress and the Congressional Innovation Fellows at meetings or events.

What we’re looking for in our Fellows:
* A technical background or ability, with experience working in or studying the technology sector.  Training can be formal (college, graduate school, the military) or informal (self-trained). 
* Great interpersonal and communications skills. 
* Ability to explain technology to those that aren’t as familiar with technology tools or concepts.
* Track record of success taking initiative and working with others.
* Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
* Committed to helping get Members of Congress and Congressional staff up to speed on technology issues.  

No experience working in or with government? Great! We're not looking for that. The Congressional Innovation Fellowship program is an opportunity to expose technology leaders like you to Capitol Hill. It is first and foremost and educational experience, giving you a one-of-its-kind education into how Congress and the government works.
