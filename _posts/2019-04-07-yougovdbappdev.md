The YouGov Data Science team is looking for a qualified database developer to design databases and build supporting applications for ingest, transformation, and analysis of large analytic datasets. The successful candidate should have experience with both SQL and NoSQL database technologies and programming applications in Python. Experience with R (our primary analytics tool) and AWS (our deployment platform) is highly desirable.

You will be a part of a cross-functional team, which includes both programmers and data scientists. You will support data scientists, who are responsible for building predictive models, and work closely with developers who build data pipelines and deploy models in production. You will be responsible for choosing the appropriate database technologies and building applications that meet demanding performance requirements. Communication and organization skills are keys for this position, along with a problem-solving attitude.
