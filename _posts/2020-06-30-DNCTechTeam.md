The DNC is charged with facilitating the Democratic presidential nominating process, and is more committed than ever to ensuring a fair, even-handed, and inclusive primary. Weâ€™ve passed historic reforms to give the grassroots a bigger voice than ever before and to showcase our candidates on an array of media platforms, including 12 Democratic presidential primary debates. This will put our eventual nominee in the strongest position possible to take back the White House in 2020.

The DNC & Coordinated Campaign Tech Teams are hiring. They have engineering and data positions available and would love to hear from you!
