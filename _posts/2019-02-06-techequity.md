The TechEquity Collaborative is a startup nonprofit that activates the tech community to create a 21st Century economy in the Bay Area that works for everyone. We believe the tech industry can be a force for broad-based opportunity rather than displacement and inequality. We focus on two issue areas: housing and workforce & labor. We engage our members in three ways: awareness-raising, volunteer opportunities, and advocacy campaigns.

The Tech Community & Product Manager will report to the Director of Programs and will:

Help to grow our community of members who have technical skills.
Manage internal and external technical projects for the organization.
Make connection points between our civic and policy goals and the technical tools that could help to advance them.
At TechEquity we’re focused on mobilizing members of the tech sector through a number of programs and advocacy initiatives, including launching our own civic tech projects. The Tech Community & Product Manager will be responsible for building and managing volunteer teams to execute on products and advise on project scoping and development. Last year, we assembled a team to prototype a voter database showing all elected officials down to the municipal level. Our next project in the pipeline is around supporting housing advocacy organizations in advocating for more housing by building on a public lands map started by the MTC.

Additionally, as a growing organization, our technical needs around CRM, website, and digital support are growing. The Tech Community & Product Manager will work cross-functionally to lead internal projects, ensuring that we’re equipped to meet the needs of our community and operate in a secure way.  

This role is ideal for someone with 3-4 years of technical experience who is looking to make the transition to product management and/or community-building or someone who has campaign experience leading tech or digital teams (such as data director, technical director, etc).
