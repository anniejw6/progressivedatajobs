The AFL-CIO is currently hiring for a data systems assistant administrator in the Data, Analytics, and Infrastructure Resource (DAIR) department. This position will be on my team, the data team, which provides vital support for our affiliate unions and AFL-CIO state federations and central labor councils for their election and other campaign work. A major part of this position will be focused on admin support for the Labor Action Network (LAN)--the labor movement's instance of the VAN--but will also work on other things, like assisting with training, data acquisition, etc.

The Data Systems Assistant Administrator plays a critical part in supporting the administration of the core infrastructure and technology that powers the Federation. A great deal of the work of this position will focus on the Labor Action Network (LAN)--the labor movement's instance of the Voter Activation Network (VAN)--but also other existing and new tools and technology. This position is part of a team responsible for coordinating the day-to-day operations of the LAN and other tools--everything from creating accounts to supporting and troubleshooting issues with users to evaluating new efficiencies in workflow and uses for the tool. The Data Systems Assistant Administrator will also work closely with AFL-CIO state federations, central labor councils, AFL-CIO affiliated unions, and local unions to assist with their needs around member engagement tools and technology. 

The Data, Analytics & Infrastructure Resource Department's goal is to generate lasting power for the labor movement, by building the Federation's programmatic tools, web development, data systems, and analytics capacity. This team serves a broad range of clients across the labor movement--from other AFL-CIO departments to AFL-CIO affiliates, and state and local labor bodies. Through investment in central infrastructure, training, and direct service work, the department aims to empower its partners to run stronger and more cost-effective political and legislative mobilization, digital, and organizing campaigns.
