Political Analyst/Senior Political Analyst
[Job description here](	https://today.yougov.com/about/careers/)

YouGov Blue is a new unit of YouGov exclusively serving Democratic and progressive clients. We leverage the panels, methodology, and technology infrastructure of YouGov to develop novel capabilities to help progressives succeed at the ballot and in the legislative arena. We are looking for individuals who are passionate about both fighting for Democratic and progressive candidates and causes and about statistics and survey methodology to come join us.

As a political analyst/senior political analyst, you will work with our clients to design survey and modeling programs, set research goals, manage the logistics of projects, and report results. You’ll analyze and interpret opinion and modeling data, and advise our clients on how to apply our learnings. You should be as comfortable discussing the finer points of survey design and methodology as you are explaining those points to people without a technical background.

We care more about your experience and skills than your schooling, but the relevant educational background is a Bachelors or Masters in the quantitative social sciences, statistics, or other relevant scientific areas.

Required Skills and Background:
• Extensive knowledge of survey research, including experience designing, fielding, and analyzing large-scale surveys and survey experiments
• Experience performing data analyses in R, Python, or comparable software
• Ability to digest and communicate statistical information to nontechnical stakeholders
• Strong project management, written and oral communication skills, and attention to detail
• Prior work experience for Democratic campaigns, polling or analytics firms, or other progressive organizations

Nice to haves:
• Experience in building hierarchical and predictive models
• Experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL
• Prior work or knowledge in digital marketing and ad tracking
• Strong knowledge of Census and other geographic data and GIS

Location: Preference for NYC or DC, but will consider remote. 

Compensation: Commensurate with experience and qualifications.

YouGov is the North American unit of YouGov PLC, with operations in the US, UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway, France, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, China, and South East Asia.

Interested candidates should submit a cover letter and resume to ginger.jacobs@yougov.com.
