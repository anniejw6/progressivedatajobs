A national non-partisan, non-profit is hiring for a large-scale coordinated civic engagement campaign active through the 2020 election cycle. The campaign aims to create a more representative democracy by registering millions of underrepresented voters across the country. This effort will focus on voter registration in a smart, targeted way by conducting at-scale, effective, efficient, metrics-driven work that will drive down the cost per net vote, build capacity for voter registration programs long term, and shape best practices for the entire field of voter registration.

We directly fund organizations who execute voter registration drives and run quality control operations, and we are dedicated to being active participants with the organizations to ensure their programs are effective and to promote an investment in their future work.

We are seeking an experienced individual to serve as the Data Director. The Data Director is an integral part of our success and will work in close collaboration with the Campaign Director and the senior staff team to use and manage our data strategically and thoughtfully that supports the campaign’s core goal of maximizing civic engagement among communities of color. This means you are able to fluidly transition between big picture strategy and troubleshooting the details of a spreadsheet as the situation requires.  

On a day to day basis, the Data Director will ensure communication between program staff and their team of four to six people working to manage the campaign’s data, analysis, and technology needs. This role is ideal for someone with a strong handle on the ins and outs of campaign data and technology and excellent communication skills with a variety of partners and communities, including technical and non-technical individuals. Experience working in data and technology with groups that connect with traditionally underrepresented communities is highly valued. 

We embrace principles of nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, or transgender or veteran status. We strongly encourage people of color, women, and LGBTQ candidates to apply. This position will be staffed through VVN, which is an equal opportunity employer.
