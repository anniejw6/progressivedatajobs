About Community Change and Community Change Action:
Community Change builds the power and capacity of low-income people, especially low-income people of color, to lead powerful and dynamic movements for social change. With our community-based partner groups, we bridge the grassroots and the national, supporting outsider strategies to disrupt the status quo while also building pathways to influence the insider conversation.

Our vision of a better world centers the leadership of impacted people of color to move our work on immigrant rights, economic justice, and racial equity, including a focus on jobs and housing, early childhood care and education, income supports, and immigration reform.

This position also supports Community Change Action, an affiliated 501(c)(4) advocacy organization. While motivated by the same core values – equity, inclusion, and justice – Community Change and Community Change Action operate independently of one another and each organization has its own board of directors.

Position Description:
The Web Developer serves as the primary administrator and a strategic authority for our growing online properties and presence. The ideal candidate will have extensive experience in website development, data analytics, and an interest in building dynamic web-based tools to support and promote our community advocacy and digital organizing work and priorities.

This position is for a motivated self- starter who loves to engage non-technical staff on strategy to innovate and redefine what it means to organize communities. Must have a well-rounded approach to development, which includes emphasis on branding, messaging, organizing, and strategizing about connecting action in the field to digital spaces and audiences.

A portion of time will be spent working with Community Change’s sister organization, Community Change Action.


Salary: $75,000 – $85,000
