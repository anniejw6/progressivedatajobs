CivicActions is looking for an experienced developer to join our Open Data Team. Our team is comprised of people who are motivated by solving interesting problems and a passion and commitment to open source software. We are looking for someone who will bring their own perspective and curiosity to work with the team toward creative solutions.

We believe in the power of open data — when data is open, so are opportunities for creativity, collaboration, and innovation. The work we do helps shape and guide the future of open source and open data. We aren’t just writing open source code, we are embedding in and foster relationships with other open data communities. All of our code is open source.

CivicActions is a dedicated, fun-loving team, looking for some talented folks to help us bring revolutionary digital services to government agencies and the people they serve.
