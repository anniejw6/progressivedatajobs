LAST CHANCE TO TAKE THE SALARY SURVEY BY 5PM ET SEPTEMBER 6TH.
Take the [2018 Salary survey](https://qtrial2018q3az1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_54pU27L9qaAmh8N0)! Your feedback is vital.

Over the past few years, a group of progressive data, analytics & tech practitioners have conducted a salary survey of people working in or adjacent to the field.

The 2018 salary survey is now open and you can [take it here](https://qtrial2018q3az1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_54pU27L9qaAmh8N). We encourage people to share it with their teams, particularly staff in more junior roles! All are encouraged to take the survey.

In order to protect everyone's privacy, all responses are anonymous and will be aggregated prior to distributing any analysis. The anonymized individual responses will be reviewed by the salary survey team:  Chelsea Harris, Sandhya Anantharaman, Anna Cooper, Lizzie Ellis, Audra Grassia.

Here's that link again: [https://qtrial2018q3az1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_54pU27L9qaAmh8N](https://qtrial2018q3az1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_54pU27L9qaAmh8N)

This survey is NOT administered by Progressive Data Jobs. However, we strongly support it as a tool for current and prospective staff in the space.
Past year's salary surveys can be found on the [resource page](https://www.progressivedatajobs.org/resources/).
