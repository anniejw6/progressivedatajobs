The Digital Associate for Advocacy Tools works with both NGP VAN’s Product Management and Engineering Teams to support our Advocacy tools.  Our clients create thousands of web-based forms with their “call to action” around a particular interest or issue to send to their supporters. In turn, those supporters use those forms to advocate to their elected representatives on behalf of those interests or issues. With web-based forms, deliverability is the name of the game and the Digital Associate is charged with ensuring that our clients' and their supporters' messages are reaching their intended targets. 

Responsibilities:

Collect data from third-party data sources to keep information about advocacy targets current
Troubleshoot submission errors in user-facing web forms
Create and maintain form definitions as our target universe changes
Work with the software engineering team to ensure the forms are corrected and properly tested
Achieve maximum deliverability!
 

Skills:

Basic understanding of HTML and CSS3 selectors
Strong attention to detail
Clear communication skills
Familiarity with HTTP response codes
 

Ideally this is a position for a patient, detail-oriented, self-starter with basic tech knowledge who is eager to start their career with a great company.
