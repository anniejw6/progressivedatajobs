Backed by best-in-class partners such as the Robin Hood Foundation, BlackRock, Google, and Salesforce, [C4Q](http://www.c4q.nyc/) creates pathways out of poverty. Our 10-month software training program raises graduates’ incomes from an average of $18,000 to $85,000 and serves an audience that is 50% women, 60% African American or Hispanic, 40% immigrant, and 55% without a college education. We have former cab drivers and retail associates now working as software engineers at leading companies such as Pinterest, Kickstarter, and Uber. 

# Scalable Impact

C4Q has structured and raised a new investment vehicle: the ‘18-85 Job Outcomes Bond (JOB).' Impact investors provide capital and receive a financial return based on whether we effectively deliver training and job outcomes for our participants. We believe that the ‘18-85 Job Outcomes Bond’ has the potential to become a national model that other non-profits can adopt -- to improve sustainability, access new pools of capital, and, most importantly, rigorously demonstrate the delivery of outcomes.
