Anne Lewis Strategies leads online communications and fundraising strategy for some of the country’s leading Democratic campaigns and top nonprofit organizations. At the heart of our business is a proprietary set of software tools that make us the best, fastest, highest-quality agency in the business.

We’re looking for an engineer who believes in using tech and data to help us elect more Democrats, propel nonprofits, and make the world a better place. She or he will develop software products to increase the speed, scale, and quality of our clients’ communications.

The Software Engineer will develop and extend an extensive codebase of mission-critical tools, which support API integrations that provide real-time analytics to client teams. She or he will work closely with the Chief Technology Officer in the architecture and development of our custom tools.

We are looking for a passionate learner: someone who loves coding, adopting new technologies, and working on a diverse team. She or he will empower us and our clients to use technology to win elections.

Roles & Responsibilities:
Here’s what you need to know: At Anne Lewis Strategies we have developed more than 20 software products. Our most impactful products are written in Node.js using the Express framework with frontends in AngularJS and React. We use both MySQL and PostgreSQL for our data stores and AWS for hosting. Our tools perform complex API integrations on platforms such as ActBlue, Blue State Digital, Convio Luminate and Salsa Labs.
A strong applicant will have professional experience working with a team using some or all of these platforms. We are interested in both mid-level and senior candidates.

Recently the CBO announced its scores for the second version of the AHCA. Within hours of the news reports hitting, we sent 4.2 million emails on behalf of our clients and drove 700,000 online actions. Because of the software products we’ve developed, Democratic voters across the country immediately learned the news and had the opportunity to take action.
Would you like to be a critical member of the team that makes this sort of awesomeness happen? Do you, like us, have one monitor full of code and another tracking the news – as well as a drive to take action and create new ways to take action? If so, we’d love to hear from you.
To apply, please send a cover letter, resume and two writing samples to hiring@annelewisllc.com and title it “Software Engineer”.
