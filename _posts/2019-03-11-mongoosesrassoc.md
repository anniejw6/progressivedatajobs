About Mongoose
Mongoose is a new consulting firm dedicated to helping organizations understand and unlock the true value of data.
We believe that being “data driven” doesn't mean making decisions in spreadsheets or spending money on predictive models or dashboards. It is an attitude toward decision-making that puts evidence first and is embraced throughout an organization.
Our mission is to teach organizations, from political campaigns to non-profit organizations to large corporations, how to really be data driven. We have advised on building new data systems, creating new data and analytics departments, and have designed and executed data driven programs for our clients.

We also:
Do all kinds of research: surveys, analytics, qualitative studies, user interviews, and more.
Help organizations develop and implement political strategy.
Help hire for technology and data positions, from entry-level to senior leadership.
Make awesome presentations that spark new ideas and spur people to take action.

The position
Senior associates are project managers and drivers of our consulting work. You will work directly with clients managing projects and providing advice. You will also help identify and develop new clients, design and deliver incredible presentations, and get plenty of hands on experience with data.

Do you have a background in data management or data engineering and want to help people do data right? You might be the person we are looking for.
