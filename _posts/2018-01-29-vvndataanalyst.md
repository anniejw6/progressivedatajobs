Data Analyst Job 

Voices Vote Now (VVN) is hiring staff for a non-partisan, large-scale coordinated voter registration campaign active 
for the 2018 through 2020 election cycles. The campaign aims to fundamentally change the nature of the 
electorate by registering millions of underrepresented voters across the country. This effort will focus on voter 
registration in a smart, targeted way by conducting at-scale, effective, efficient, metrics-driven registration work 
that will drive down the cost per net vote, build capacity for voter registration programs long term, and shape best 
practices for the entire field of voter registration. We directly fund organizations who execute voter registration
drives and run quality control operations, and we are dedicated to being active participants with the organizations 
to ensure their programs are effective and to promote an investment in the future of emerging communities.

# Position 
The campaign seeks an individual with experience managing or analyzing data to serve as a Data Analyst reporting 
to the Data and Analytics Director.  The Data Analyst will be responsible for analyzing large datasets for patterns or 
trends that result in actionable recommendations to improve the efficiency of voter registration programs, with a 
secondary focus on providing as needed data support for voter registration programs in the field. The campaign 
will provide training and support to develop new skills, ranging from technical analytics and statistics to
presentation and communication. This individual will be at the forefront of the campaign’s effort to develop metric 
based programs integrated into a data-driven strategy, working closely with the campaign’s senior staff and with 
partner organizations. The campaign seeks to hire for this position immediately, and it is a three year position that 
will go beyond the 2020 cycle. 

The Data Analyst will:

* Use data to answer important questions about program effectiveness (such as: which types of field offices
are best at registering people of color, which digital advertising track is most cost-effective, or how many 
unregistered people of color are projected to be in a given county in three years)
* Contribute to organizational and campaign strategy
* Independently generate research questions and project ideas
* Communicate clearly and effectively about technical topics with colleagues and partner organizations
* Design and deliver presentations and memos that summarize research and make actionable recommendations 
* Help design and manage metrics for evaluating voter registration programs
* Provide backup data support to field organizations running registration programs on an as needed basis

This is a great opportunity for someone who:

* Is hungry to learn and develop their quantitative analysis skills 
* Loves the idea of working with new large datasets and pioneering analysis techniques for voter registration
* Wants to come up with big questions, develop a strategy for getting an answer, and power through to figure out the best answer
* Is at home dissecting code or a complicated spreadsheet 
* Enjoys collaboratively discovering the takeaways of data analysis with colleagues and peers, including both technical and non-technical people
* Is passionate about civic participation 

Desired qualities for the Data Analyst:

* Committed to the idea of changing the nature of the electorate
* Deep commitment to voter registration as a key component of any long-term strategy for making progressive policy change
* Demonstrated ability to independently conceptualize and complete research and analysis 
* Introductory experience with SQL 
* Introductory experience with statistical analysis techniques and associated software like R or Python
* Commitment to testing and research and an understanding of the importance of data in driving and increasing effectiveness and efficiency 
* Ability to work as part of a collaborative team 
* Superior communication skills 

Preferred but not required:

* Experience working with Census data
* Experience using data to develop strategic campaign plans
* Knowledge of both national and state structures of the progressive infrastructure and coalition partners
* Previous experience working with VAN, Catalist, or other individual-level data used to target and implement civic engagement programs
* Experience working in the fields of voter registration or voting rights
* Experience analyzing policy or randomized controlled experiments
* Experience with mapping software
