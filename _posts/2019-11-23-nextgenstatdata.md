NextGen America acts politically to prevent climate disaster, promote prosperity, and protect the fundamental rights of every American.  Since our founding as NextGen Climate in 2013, we’ve worked to fight climate change by advancing the transition to a clean energy economy. We’ve supported candidates who support climate action. We’ve fought to halt the Keystone XL pipeline and registered more than 1 million voters nationwide.  Now, the same values that drive our work on climate are under unprecedented attack from all directions. We’re proud to step up the fight for immigrant rights, affordable health care, prosperity, and equality.

NextGen America is seeking a detail-oriented Data Directors to join our team through the 2020 election. The Data Director will oversee the data program in the state, working closely with and supported by the national data team. Responsibilities include providing field staff training, support with data systems and processes, and reporting and analysis. Ability to collaborate across departments, including digital, press, and operations, is essential. This is a great opportunity for someone who enjoys solving problems, is good at explaining concepts to audiences with little to no context, and can juggle multiple tasks at once.
