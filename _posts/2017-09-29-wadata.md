The Senior and Assistant Data Administrator positions assist Working America's Data Director with data operations and reporting; the distinction is based on level of experience. These are permanent positions, and require a commitment through the end of 2018. Location: Washington, DC only.

Experience with VAN, Quick Base, SQL, Access, Python, and R are a plus.
