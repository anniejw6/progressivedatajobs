Color Of Change is the nation’s largest online racial justice organization. As a national online force driven by 1.5 million members, we move decision-makers in corporations and government to create a more human and less hostile world for Black people in America. We activate our members to take action on crucial issues — from criminal justice to media representations to the social safety net and voter freedom — so that we can build the power necessary to transform the written and unwritten rules of society. Our work – both rapid response and long-term campaigns for change – amplifies the voices of Black folks and our allies, building power and delivering meaningful wins that create consequences for racial injustice and build momentum for implementing solutions that move Black people and all people forward.


Color Of Change is hiring a National Data Director to lead the expansion of its data operations across a broad spectrum of digital campaigns, field organizing, and electoral mobilization. This is a unique opportunity to join a deeply-skilled and innovative team at the forefront of Black liberation and empowerment within a rapidly growing, digitally-driven organization with a budget of $21 million.


The National Data Director position is a hybrid role for a senior leader possessing broad skills in the field of digital campaigning. The ideal candidate will be fluent in strategic data analysis. They will also possess the management and communication skills to effectively build and develop a data-driven culture across an entire organization. 


While strategic use of data is important across many aspects of the organization, the primary role of this position is focused on helping our campaigns team meet digital fundraising and growth goals -- with particular focus on engaging members through our email program.


You’ll have direct reports to delegate responsibilities to, but the nature of the role will also require your own deep direct engagement with data. Meeting these goals will require not only the analytical skills to develop actionable insights from our data, but also the management skills to turn those insights into clear processes that the team can execute on.


The National Data Director will be based in one of four Color Of Change offices (Oakland, CA, Washington DC, Los Angeles or New York City).


Salary: $130,000 - $135,000
