Political Data Specialist, CWA -- Washington, DC

The Political Department at CWA has pioneered a leadership development program (Boot Camps) that have been ongoing for almost 5 years. We have developed a large cadre of rank and file activists that have increased their political organizer skills and are aligned in a critical analysis of the current economic and political crisis facing working class people in America and around the world today. We are looking for a experienced political data organizer that can lead our programs data operations and further expand our field use and capacity of data for political work. They will have a critical role in training and developing our best and most developed rank and file organizers to the highest level of running political data within their states. This is an amazing opportunity for anyone that wants to help further build one of the most radical and militant rank and file programs in labor.
