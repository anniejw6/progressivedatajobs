Hustle is hiring both Back End & Front End Senior Product Engineers.

We are seeking a senior product engineer to join us in growing Hustle’s peer-to-peer messaging platform. Hustle powers human-to-human communication of progressive organizations like Planned Parenthood, the Service Employees International Union, New York University and Democratic political campaigns as well as established for-profit companies like Lyft and LiveNation. The right candidate will be excited to join a nimble and experienced engineering team in a fast-growing company that is re-imagining how the world communicates.

As a senior product engineer you will own Hustle's core web and mobile products and the services that power them. These products and services are built end to end in JavaScript - React & React Native in front of Node.js over Mongo, which enables you to be as full-stack as you want to be. We will never box you in or out. Candidates that have deep experience building scalable, reliable back-end systems will be an asset to the team. APIs and service composition, performant and scalable NoSQL databases, state management and caching strategies, idempotency… yeah, that’s you.

WHAT YOU GET TO DO EVERY DAY:

* Build mobile, web, and backend SaaS components that make our diverse and growing range of customers ever more effective
