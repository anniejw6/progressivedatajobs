TIME’S UP is looking for a Database Manager to manage TIME’S UP’s organization-wide relationship management database, which is central to the development team’s management of relationships with its donors and prospective donors. The Development Database Manager is the Development team’s principal user EveryAction database and serves as an internal specialist and a resource to both internal and external constituents for the donor data management system. As such, the Database Manager helps the organization, but particularly the development team, maximize the fundraising and marketing potential of the donor database through accurate and effective management of donor and high-level stakeholder information and relationships and ensures an exemplary level of data integrity in EveryAction.

This position develops and executes standard and custom queries, reports, and lists for various departments, with an emphasis on donor and prospect mailings and revenue tracking—determining with staff which reports are needed regularly (monthly, weekly, etc.) and setting them up to allow self-service reporting—and helps development staff follow established processes and procedures for use of EveryAction.

TIME’S UP is an organization that insists on safe, fair and dignified work for women of all kinds. We want women from the factory floor to the floor of the Stock Exchange, from child care centers to C-suites, from farm fields to the tech field, to be united by a shared sense of safety, fairness and dignity as they work and as we all shift the paradigm of workplace culture.

Powered by women, our TIME’S UP™ programming addresses the systemic inequality and injustice in the workplace that have kept underrepresented groups from reaching their full potential. We partner with leading advocates for equality and safety to improve laws and corporate policies; help change the face of corporate boardrooms and the C-suite; and enable more women and men to access our legal system to hold wrongdoers accountable.
