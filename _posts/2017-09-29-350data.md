350.org is seeking a data manager
[Job description here](https://350.org/jobs/?gh_jid=836875)

At 350.org, we believe in a safe climate and a better future — a just, prosperous, and equitable world built with the power of ordinary people.

Said another way: We’re aiming to make the kind of change the world needs, not what’s been deemed “politically feasible” by governments. We pick unrealistic fights, and then win them.

We’re looking for a driven and creative Data Manager to ensure that 350.org’s digital properties and tools are optimized for performance, and engage in big-picture strategic thinking about how technology, data, and code can serve the organization’s goals.

We’re looking for someone who is 100% committed to building a better world as fast as we possibly can, and has the talent and heart to deliver. Is that you?
