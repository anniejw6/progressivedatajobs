The National Center for Transgender Equality seeks a research project director to oversee the new U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS). The USTS will be the next iteration of and follow-up to the 2015 USTS. The position is expected to last through the completion of the primary survey report (2020) and may extend into 2021. The candidate will act as a project manager and will lead the development, fielding, analysis, report writing and presentation of the USTS. The Survey Project Director will hire and supervise a full-time outreach manager as well as interns, and will recruit and manage several scientific and community experts, and a range of consultants, as well as the research team.
Located in Washington, DC, this is an incredible opportunity to significantly contribute to the knowledge base about transgender people, including those who identify as non-binary. The survey research team has already begun working and has already planned improvements over the last iteration. The survey is online and will be again offered in English and Spanish.
