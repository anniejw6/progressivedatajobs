CREDO Action organizes and mobilizes millions of activists to fight for progressive change at the local, state and national levels. From relentlessly defending reproductive freedom, civil rights, LGBTQ equality and our environment to fixing our broken democracy and fighting for an economy that works for everyone, CREDO empowers activists to work for the change we want to see, not what we are told we can achieve by the mainstream political establishment.

We're looking for someone with a solid command of SQL and data analysis who wants to run all of our reporting and experimentation!

San Francisco, Denver, or remote. Full-time, long-term. 

Salary: Compensation will be determined based on where you live and your level of experience, but we expect the salary range to be between $75,00 and $90,000. In addition to this base salary, CREDO employees are eligible for annual merit bonuses of up to 17%.
