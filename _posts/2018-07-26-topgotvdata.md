2018 County Data Managers Dallas & Harris Counties 
Here at the Texas Organizing Project (TOP), we work to improve the lives of low and moderate income, primarily Black and Brown families, in the second largest State in the Union.  While Texas is the fastest growing State we are alarmed by the growing poverty rate, lack of access to quality health care and education, racist immigration laws and policies, a culture of mass incarceration, and elected officials who are out of step with our community’s values.   We are proud to say that TOP has a proven track record of running winning issue and electoral campaigns that address these challenges.  We know that to win a reflective democracy in Texas we must build power through community organizing, partnering with progressive organizations and labor unions, and expanding civic engagement. 
TOP’s 2018 electoral field program will outreach to nearly half a million voters in Texas’s biggest three Counties; Harris, Dallas, and Bexar.  The populations of these targeted Counties’ are comparable to the populations of Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico respectively. 
TOP is a dynamic, important, and growing membership based organization.  Our members conduct issue advocacy, lobbying efforts and electoral organizing on behalf of working families in Texas.  We organize in Harris, Dallas, and Bexar Counties. We are an energetic and tight knit team that works hard and is supportive of each other.  We are a financially viable and family friendly organization.   We are looking for people who want to take their work to the next level.
