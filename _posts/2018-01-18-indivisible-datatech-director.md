The Data and Technology Director will be in charge of managing the data, analytics, and reporting systems of the Indivisible Project. Our work happens in local communities via 6,000 groups around the country, via email and SMS, and online via social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Indivisible’s Data and Technology Director will be responsible for managing the development of data and technological infrastructure and systems that best facilitate and optimize Indivisible’s mission to build a sustainable, growing, and increasingly impactful grassroots political force.

Our organization’s work encompasses mass grassroots mobilization to advocate for a progressive vision at the federal level, working towards progressive electoral outcomes at every level of government, and building solid infrastructure to support a national progressive movement. This position will involve bringing proven data and technology solutions from advocacy and electoral efforts to Indivisible, as well as creating new data and technology approaches for problems we are attempting to solve for the first time and the opportunities we face that are unique to our movement and the current moment.

This position is part of the organization's senior team and will report to our COO. The person in this role will manage direct reports as well as work directly to support data staff working within the communications, organizing, and political departments.

We are hiring for this position immediately in our Washington, DC office. This position is full-time, with a minimum salary of $90,000 annually, commensurate with experience. Indivisible provides a robust benefits package including full medical/dental/vision/life coverage, a discounted gym membership, and an employer matched 401(k) plan.

Responsibilities:

* Holding, managing, and being responsible for supporting Indivisible’s overall data and technology infrastructure. Specifically, it would be this individual’s responsibility to ensure that our databases are synced and that our data processes are standardized
* Responsible for building the overall reporting framework that will allow the organization to:
    - Optimize the relationships between our different technologies and data sources
    - Get a holistic sense of how we are achieving our KPIs
    - Providing analyses to leadership about ways we can better perform towards those goals
* Supporting the departmental data staff in their work, specifically:
    - How their work is relating to Indivisible’s overall ecosystem
    - How to better accomplish their departmental priorities
    - Their professional development as progressive data/tech staffers
* Ensuring that new technology and data can be, and is, integrated into Indivisible’s overall data architecture. Indivisible departments each determine their needs and the Director’s role involves helping reach the programmatic goals established by Indivisible’s departments. However, decisions to select and deploy specific technologies and systems could have implications for budgeting, legal compliance, redundancy of systems across the organization, and integration. The Director would be responsible for vetting new technology for these criteria, and would be a key stakeholder in selection of any  technologies and systems.
* Managing cross-departmental data work and communication

* Experience training and working with non-technical staff in data protocols and standards

Qualifications (Desired):

About the Indivisible Project

We are a dynamic, non-profit organization seeking initial full-time hires to support our mission: resisting Trump’s agenda by empowering local activist groups to make their Members of Congress listen. Our work is premised on a simple idea: that Trump’s agenda doesn’t depend on Trump--but rather on whether individual Members of Congress resist. In short, we work to support the creative, local leaders driving the Indivisible Movement.

Following the election of Donald Trump, a group of two dozen former congressional staffers and progressive advocates drafted a document called “Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda.” What is the Indivisible Guide? It’s a toolkit on citizen power, a set of local, defensive advocacy strategies and tactics for resisting the Trump agenda. Thousands of local groups have now formed in nearly every congressional district in the country to put the the guide into action.
