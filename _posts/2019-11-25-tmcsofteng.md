Looking for something different than the “normal tech job”? Looking for a way to channel your software skills into improving the country’s political landscape? TMC is uniquely positioned in the progressive tech ecosystem to scale engineering innovation as we support many of the most exciting and impactful nationwide advocacy organizations.

As a software engineer at TMC, you will help progressive organizations across the country reach their goals by building tools to improve their use of data and third-party advocacy products. You’ll work closely with our support team to understand organizations’ technical needs and the shortcomings of existing tools, and in turn, you will design and build tools to fill those gaps.

In this role, you will:

Write code and lead projects across the software stack, with a particular focus on data pipelines.
Build cloud infrastructure to support our data science and analysis projects.
Contribute to software architecture discussions and decisions.
Moderate open-source projects that will benefit the broader progressive tech community.
Evaluate 3rd-party tools, to help TMC members decide which to use, and to influence the vendors’ product roadmaps.
Identify technology gaps in the progressive ecosystem, and create tools to fill those gaps.
Train our Data & Technology Team on software engineering best practices.
Contribute to long-term planning and strategy discussions for TMC, as technology is central to TMC’s mission.
