The Organizing Data Manager will have a unique opportunity to join a large, deeply-skilled, and innovative campaigns team within a rapidly growing, digitally-driven organization at the forefront of Black liberation and empowerment.


This role will primarily focus on data management to maximize the impact of Color Of Change’s organizing events, field work, and electoral engagement of members. However, when capacity and needs warrant, this role will also assist with data management within the digital/email advocacy campaigning environment, in collaboration with the Digital Data Director and National Data Director.


The right candidate will combine strong data skills with effective communication abilities to help build Color Of Change’s data-driven culture.


The Organizing Data Manager will be based in one of four Color Of Change offices (Washington DC, New York City, Oakland, or Los Angeles) and report to the National Data Director.


Salary: $76,000
