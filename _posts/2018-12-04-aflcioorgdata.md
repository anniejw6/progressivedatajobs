Are you the kind of person who lives and breathes organizing? Are you obsessed with building power for working people through collective action? Do you understand that technology is not a substitute for good face-to-face organizing but recognize the opportunity it provides to make traditional organizing campaigns more efficient? If so, you may be the person we are looking for.

The AFL-CIO ' in partnership with Action Network ' is about to launch ActionBuilder, the first tool for worker organizing built through a co-design process with multiple organizers across the labor movement. ActionBuilder will be able to be used on any device and will allow unions to track organizing conversations through an easy-to-use interface and database, let lead organizers easily assign tasks to their staff and activist members, customize the tool to their organizing campaigns' structure and much more. You will be part of a team that will ensure the successful launch of ActionBuilder and provide ongoing support and strategic guidance on how to use the tool to supplement organizing campaigns for AFL-CIO affiliate unions, state federations, CLCs and other stakeholders.

You should have a passion for organizing with specific background in labor organizing. You do not need to have extensive experience administering similar technology (we will train you) but have an interest in how data can be used to make organizing campaigns more effective.
