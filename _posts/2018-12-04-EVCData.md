Everybody Votes is a non-partisan, large-scale coordinated civic engagement campaign active through the 2020 election cycle. The campaign aims to create a more representative democracy by registering millions of underrepresented voters across the country. This effort will focus on voter registration in a smart, targeted way by conducting at-scale, effective, efficient, metrics-driven work that will drive down the cost per net vote, build capacity for voter registration programs long term, and shape best practices for the entire field of voter registration. 
We directly fund organizations who execute voter registration drives and run quality control operations, and we are dedicated to being active participants with the organizations to ensure their programs are effective and to promote an investment in the future of emerging communities.
