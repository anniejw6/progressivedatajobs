Join the Accelerator.
Applications for Cohort 2 are open now. [Apply here](https://www.highergroundlabs.com/apply)
Are you building a new tech product to meet a challenge confronting progressive campaigns and causes? Can your company make a difference in the political space in the 2018 election cycle? Apply for HGL's Accelerator Program!

Applications for our second cohort are now open and close on Monday, January 15, 2018 at 5pm CT. There will be 3 rounds of interviews from mid-January to the end of February, and the cohort will be selected by early March.

Each Accelerator company receives a financial investment to help move products to market quickly. They also receive coaching from political and tech leaders; connections with fellow entrepreneurs; and access to potential funders and clients. The program will run from April to July 2018, so that HGL's Accelerator can super-charge the cohort's impact on the 2018 races.
