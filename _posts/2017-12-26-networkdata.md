While rooted in Catholic Social Justice, NETWORK is open to all who share our passion for justice. Staff and members are people from a variety of religious and nonreligious backgrounds.  As an organization and workplace, NETWORK values work-life balance and strives to be a supportive workplace environment where staff embrace the “Sister-Spirit” of our founders by rooting our understanding in encounter, not ideology; prioritizing the well-being of others; seeing everyone as people first, not just roles; and using humor and being feisty in order to be bold and willing to do the unpopular.
