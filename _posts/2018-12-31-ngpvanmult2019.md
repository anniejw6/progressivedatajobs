NGP VAN counts thousands of campaigns and organizations among our clients, including all the national Democratic committees, thousands of Democratic campaigns, and hundreds of labor unions, progressive and non-partisan PACs, and other organizations. Weâ€™re committed to crafting the next generation of integrated campaign technology, so our clients have the edge they need to win.

At NGP VAN, you don't just benefit from a competitive salary, generous health insurance, and some seriously awesome co-workers. We offer perks like plenty of vacation days (no questions asked), biennial company retreats (think somewhere sunny and warm), a company-wide hackathon (we provide the food, you bring the ideas), and endless snacks to keep you energized. We invest in our people because we only grow when they do - and that's why we've been named one of the coolest companies in DC, and one of the best places to work in the U.S.

RECEIVE GREAT BENEFITS
We help you take care of yourself so you can focus on taking care of our clients - that includes 100% health care premiums paid, annual profit-sharing, and paid, annual professional development.

FULLY PAID PARENTAL LEAVE
We offer fully paid parental leave, so you can take time off to bond with your little one.

VACATION DAYS
Planning a sunny getaway? Or looking forward to a staycation? We have a generous vacation policy, so you can enjoy time off whenever and wherever.

RISE TO THE CHALLENGE
Our annual Hackathon gives you the chance to step into the driver's seat, creating cool products and features that aren't already on the NGP VAN roadmap.
