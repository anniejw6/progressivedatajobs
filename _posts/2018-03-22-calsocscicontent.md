Social Science & Content Coordinator

The Climate Advocacy Lab
The Climate Advocacy Lab helps climate and clean energy advocates run smarter public
engagement campaigns. Launched in 2015, the Lab has quickly grown to be a network of 2,000+
advocates, social scientists, data experts and funders developing and sharing evidence-based
best practices for what works--and what doesn’t--for engaging and mobilizing Americans on
climate and clean energy. In addition to running workshops and trainings for the community,
the Lab also facilitates and gives grants to support field research aimed at testing how best to
engage people on these issues.

Position Description
The Social Science & Content Coordinator will develop and maintain the Lab’s body of training
and reference resources, drawing on social science and gray literature, field research, and
polling. This role will also involve working with members of the academic and advocacy
communities on field research projects to expand our evidence base. This position will work
closely with an existing social scientist on the Lab team, and others with backgrounds in climate
advocacy. Applicants should have both a grounding in the relevant research, as well as an
abiding passion for employing that expertise to help climate advocates translate knowledge
into wins on this urgent issue. The position is available as either a one-year fellowship or as
permanent staff, upon arrangement at the time of hiring.
