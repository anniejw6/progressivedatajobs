[Job description here](https://boards.greenhouse.io/forourfuture/jobs/808822#.WasPTJN97fZ).

For Our Future aims to win elections and gain political power by engaging and mobilizing people and community-based organizations on progressive issues. Building off of our 2016 campaign in five battleground states, FOF will continue its unique and now-proven model to build infrastructure and power for progressive issues and candidates in Virginia in 2017 and beyond. The model is to work with and through community-based organizations and local activist networks, with a focus on direct voter contact and earned media. Our goal is to turn communicators into connectors, engage communities in policy discussions, and turn out voters for progressive issues and Election Day victories.
