DigiDems was founded in 2018 to fill a talent gap in the Democratic campaign ecosystem in an effort to help Democrat's leverage the new technology created after the 2016 election to make campaigns more secure, efficient, and effective. The organization recruited and trained skilled technology talent to build stronger Democratic campaigns, and two years and 88 embedded technologists later, we’re continuing our work to build a new, reliable pipeline of high-skilled tech talent that Democratic campaigns can deploy in 2020 and beyond.  


In 2019, we decided to build on this work when we launched the Blue Leadership Collaborative, seeking to strengthen the pipeline of skilled democratic campaign operatives who can lead winning campaigns. Our inaugural class of BLC fellows is now out in the field managing down-ballot campaigns in the 2020 cycle, and we have a new set of 15 remarkable fellows in Texas, who will help lead campaigns across the state to finally turn Texas blue.

 

Under the structure of Zinc Collective, DigiDems and BLC will continue to strengthen Democratic campaign talent for election cycles to come
