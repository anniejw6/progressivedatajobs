The Data Assistant will play a critical part in supporting the administration of the core infrastructure and technology that powers the Federation's Joint Mobilization program in 2020. A great deal of the work of this position will focus on the Labor Action Network (LAN)--the labor movement's instance of the Voter Activation Network (VAN)--but also other tools and technology used by the Federation to run effective and efficient electoral programs. This position is part of a team responsible for coordinating the day-to-day operations of the LAN and other tools--everything from creating accounts to supporting and troubleshooting technical issues users have with the tools needed to run large scale, primarily remote programs. The Data Assistant will also work closely with AFL-CIO state federations, central labor councils, AFL-CIO affiliated unions, and local unions to assist with their needs around setting up and utilizing various voter contact technology.

The Data, Analytics & Infrastructure Resource Department's goal is to generate lasting power for the labor movement, by building the Federation's programmatic tools, web development, data systems, and analytics capacity. This team serves a broad range of clients across the labor movement--from other AFL-CIO departments to AFL-CIO affiliates, and state and local labor bodies. Through investment in central infrastructure, training, and direct service work, the department aims to empower its partners to run stronger and more cost-effective political and legislative mobilization, digital, and organizing campaigns.

This is a temporary position not to exceed November 30, 2020.
