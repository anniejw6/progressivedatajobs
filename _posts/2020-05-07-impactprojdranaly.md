The Impact Project creates a year-round cycle of engagement to meet two linked objectives in each of our states: 1) advancing progressive economic and democracy policies, and 2) shaping the issue and political environment so that the states become more progressive over time. 

The Director of Analytics is a key part of our work on public education campaigns focused on middle and working class audiences and on our voter engagement efforts of under-represented populations. They ensure that our investments are informed by the latest experiments and that there are tests in place to ultimately reveal whether the investments are working. The position will work with staff and grantees to identify target audiences and models, set up treatment and control groups, analyze experiment results, and present findings to staff and partners. 

We’re looking for someone who has worked on advocacy campaigns, can manage and move data across multiple entities, and find the lessons in the numbers. The position requires a keen analytical mind, attention to detail, and topnotch organizational skills. Must be able to communicate with practitioners in the field and explain issues and solutions to a nontechnical audience. This position is exempt for overtime purposes, and reports to the Director of Engagement. 

About The Impact Project 

We are about building enduring power through advocacy, organizing, and communications that advance progressive economic and democracy policies. Current progressive work in the states is largely focused on short-term issue-specific campaigns. While this strategy has proven effective in securing specific policies, a more comprehensive approach is required to fundamentally change these states. Our work is focused in AZ, CO, FL, ME, MD, MI, NV, NC, PA, and VA. You’ll have the freedom to look across issues, across organizations, and across legislative sessions to build the power needed to create and sustain a progressive policy environment in the states. 

Our Culture 

It’s a fast-paced culture where we aim for excellence. We love data, experimentation, and learning from both successes and failures (instead of fearing them). We seek team members who are creative, communicative self-starters who enjoy collaboration and are interested in taking their work to the next level. The core values we live by include: 
* Agile – We move quickly and easily. We adapt. 
* Bold – We take risks. We are fearless in the face of big challenges. 
* Curious – We have a thirst for data and question assumptions. 
* Creative Disruptors – We stretch beyond the norm. We bring new ideas, new partners, and new strategies. 
* Dig Deep – We aren’t looking for surface wins, but fundamental shifts in power. 

Essential Duties and Responsibilities

* Help analyze data sets from grantee phone, digital, mail, etc. programs. We want to assess 
audience reach across multiple partner groups, whether different audience segments are performing as forecast, and which audiences are responding to which tactics and issues.
