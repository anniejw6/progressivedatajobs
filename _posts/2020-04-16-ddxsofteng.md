The Democratic Data Exchange (DDx) is looking for engineers at all levels to support the development of a new data exchange platform that expands the Democratic and progressive data ecosystem. The DDx is a remote-first organization of about a dozen individuals spread across the country. Many of us work out of our DC office but we provide both equipment and coworking space reimbursement. Our benefits also include company-provided medical, dental and vision plans and unlimited PTO.

As part of the engineering team you’ll have the opportunity to work on a modern codebase and directly contribute to the culture and success of the DDx! The Exchange, our software platform, will require engineers to build out significant portions of our data pipeline using industry standard tools and languages as well as handle deployment and operation of the Exchange in the cloud.

**At DDx we believe...**
* Empathy is the most important part of being a good engineer
* Inclusivity builds stronger, more supportive teams
* Thoughtfulness is good for engineering and good for teamwork
* Mentorship is something everyone should be involved in
* A bias towards action is better than delaying for a perfect solution
* Making mistakes is inevitable on the path to becoming a great engineer

We don’t expect every applicant to know or have worked with every technology we’ve listed, or have worked with everything we’ll be working on at the DDx so we urge you to apply if you’re interested and some of the above applies to you! We’re looking for engineers of all levels and hiring for the people over the position above all else.

As a DDx engineer you should…
* Act autonomously but thrive in a strong team environment
* Be able to work with, clarify and find creative solutions for ambiguous requirements
* Have built performant data orchestration pipelines and ETL applications
* Have managed infrastructure and deployments in cloud environments
* Be familiar with continuous integration and continuous delivery
* Write test suites, integration tests and unit tests for your code
* Have worked with data warehousing or analytics focused databases
* Prefer open source solutions over commercial solutions

At DDx we use things like…
* Python, Scala, SQL
* Apache Spark, Apache Airflow
* Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins
* AWS Lambda, IAM, KMS, SQS, SNS and more
* Snowflake Data Warehouse
* Google Cloud Platform - BigQuery, Composer and more
* Javascript/Typescript (React, Angular 2+), OIDC (Okta)


The DDx is committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace - we’re proud to be an equal opportunity and inclusive employer. 

This is a remote position, intended to start as soon as possible. 

We will review applicants on a rolling basis but encourage people to apply by May 1, 2020. Qualified applicants may be asked to take place in a series of interviews and a technical task


Salary: Very competitive

Location: Remote
