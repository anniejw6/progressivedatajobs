Following the successful first conference in November 2016, we're bringing Crack the Code back, and this time we're coming to New York City! 
Mark your calendars for March 17, and sign up today!

What is Crack the Code?

Crack the Code is a conference to promote the personal and professional growth of women and genderqueer people who work in progressive data, analytics, and technology. Crack the Code is a trans-friendly space. Crack the Code 2018 will take place on Saturday, March 17th, 2018 in New York City. 

This year, we're focusing on how people can personally and professionally advance in the space. That means we’re putting a bigger emphasis on managing up, down, and sideways; figuring out when it’s the right time to move onto your next role; and pairing attendees with experts on resume and cover letter writing, negotiation, and more. 

What are you waiting for? [Register today!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5TPhPZTqe7EGU_yZM-iKSilOEl9oG99gq-jqU9tEUhdD2bA/viewform)

We are also looking for speakers to help make this conference a success, especially encouraging first-time speakers. You can give a 5-minute lightning talk or sit on a panel. You can even share your resume writing skills with your fellow practitioners and share career advice one-on-one.
