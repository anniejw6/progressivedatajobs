Global Strategy Group works at the intersection of politics, business, and causes, conducting research for national political leaders, Fortune 100 clients, and non-profits. Our research practice is rooted in politics with extensive experience on electoral campaigns for clients such as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) and Jacky Rosen (NV), along with multiple Governors, and six new members of the U.S. House of Representatives. 

Global Strategy Group is seeking a political data expert who is passionate about analyzing voter data and excited to explore innovative polling methodologies. This position will largely be focused on two closely aligned areas:

- Political data, targeting, modeling, & analysis: GSG was actively involved in over 100 races across the country in 2018. As we gear up for 2020, our team of researchers needs a partner who is a political data expert with extensive experience using and analyzing voter files. This position will work closely with teams to ensure we are accurately targeting and weighting likely voters across all GSG polls.

- Implement new polling methodologies: Data operations at GSG is a well-run machine with a clear set of processes and quality control standards for traditional telephone and online surveys. We are looking for a data expert who will learn our current system, while actively identifying new and better polling methodologies, and streamlining the process for implementing those new methodologies.

As you can expect from a firm based in politics, GSG’s work environment is fast-paced and demanding – especially at the height of political season. Ideal candidates will thrive in a fast-paced deadline-oriented environment and dedicate themselves to serving our clients. This position may be filled at either a more junior or a more senior level, as we are open to candidates with varied expertise in the required areas.
