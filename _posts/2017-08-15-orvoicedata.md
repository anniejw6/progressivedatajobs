Job Description
Oregon Voice seeks a trained technician with a passion for politics and social justice to join our team. We are
looking for someone with a rare skill set: expertise using a number of tools, VAN, Catalist data, and census
related databases, as well as the ability to translate the purpose and value of these tools to a wide range of
audiences and partner organizations. The Data & Targeting Director drives training and support for partner
organizations to take a data-driven approach and to integrate tools like VAN into their organizing & advocacy
work.
