Do you want to ensure that progressive organizations have access to the best possible data, technology, and technical expertise? We know movement organizing and advocacy are more urgent than ever, and many organizations and activists cannot easily access the tools to scale their work. 

Launched in 2017, The Movement Cooperative was founded with the aim of addressing these structural challenges. Currently our membership stands at more than 20 groups, with more organizations slated to join in the coming months.

# Position Description

Membership with The Movement Cooperative affords organizations full access to our data warehouse and analytics platform, in addition to unlimited access to national voter/consumer files. Our role is to provide the technical assistance and expertise members need to get started, and the ongoing support to achieve their goals and maximize their impact. We help with the establishment of syncs and data pipelines from a continually-expanding suite of organizing and digital tools.

In this role, you will:

* Provide thoughtful and speedy support to diverse members with differing needs and varying levels of expertise with data and technology
* Utilize the central data warehouse to manipulate, analyze, and support members in understanding their data

* Train on the strategic use of the voter file and predictive models
* Lead conversations on both traditional and more experimental methodologies for persuasion, turnout, and organizing efforts
* Build tools that scale the team's work across all members
