The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national, state and local priorities. LCV, in collaboration with our state LCV partners, advocates for sound environmental laws and policies, holds elected officials accountable for their votes and actions, and elects pro-environment candidates who will champion our priority issues.
The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) and our sister organization, LCV Education Fund, are national environmental organizations with a strong commitment to racial justice and equity. With more than 30 state affiliates across the country, LCV and LCV Education Fund are committed to building a movement in which everyday people have the right and responsibility to be able to influence the policies and policy makers that affect our air, water, lands and the health of our communities and planet. Engaging communities of color among other key constituencies for the environment is an organizational priority. Within the organization, we aim to create a workplace culture and policies and practices that demonstrate how we value equity and inclusion.
