Who We Are
PEU is a newer initiative of the city that uses proactive data-driven outreach strategies to connect New Yorkers with vital city services, especially in the realm of housing and health care. The Data and Analytics Team drives, analyzes and supports this outreach work, including reporting and custom data analysis, as well as data management and data collection systems development.

Who You Are
We're especially looking for folks with experience and/or interest in one (or both) of the following:
Data analysis and reporting - Like any good outreach program, we keep track of a variety of metrics in order to identify opportunities for growth. We need someone who has a knack for putting together reports and other tools to help our outreach leads better strategize around their programatic goals.
Nice to Have: We love to work with someone who's worked with political campaign data or other outreach data previously. Alternatively, working with government data before would be a plus.
Data engineering - We deal with data from various agencies around the city that are in varying levels of messy (think Secretary of State data, but sometimes worse). We need someone who has a knack for taking multiple messy datasets and writing automated code to turn them into beautiful, analyzable tables. 

Neither of those really what gets you excited? We're also looking for experience with:
Project management - We are in the midst of overhauling our case management system, which is a huge undertaking. We need someone who can keep track of all the moving pieces and also help anticipate the tasks involved for the Data and Analytics team in contributing to the completion of our development milestones.
