For 50 years, NARAL has led the fight for reproductive freedom for everyone, including the right to access abortion.

NARAL is powered by our more than 2.3 million members — in every state and congressional district. We represent the more than seven in 10 Americans who believe every person should have the freedom to make the best decision for themselves about if, when, and how to raise a family.

We organize and mobilize in neighborhoods, communities, cities, and states, galvanizing millions of people to take action to defend reproductive freedom in the face of unprecedented attacks.

We are the oldest and largest national membership organization primarily focused on advocating for abortion access. In recognition of our work defending the constitutional right to abortion, Fortune Magazine rated NARAL as “one of the top 10 advocacy groups in America.”


Position Overview
 
NARAL is seeking a Deputy Director of Strategic Research to help lead our deep-level research and messaging program. Our nuanced and sophisticated research is the backbone of rethinking and reshaping how NARAL and our allies talk about abortion and reproductive freedom and combating the anti-choice opposition’s disinformation.
 

The ideal candidate is curious, organized and resourceful with excellent writing and editing skills and a solid understanding of opinion research and messaging. This person will work on multiple projects at once and should have a track record of success as a project manager.

 
Duties include guiding research and messaging projects internally and with outside stakeholders; editing and writing reports, memos and proposals; and translating research into understandable information for staff; presenting research findings; and providing training opportunities on messaging.

 
You’ll be a great fit if you’re passionate about reproductive freedom, have excellent project management skills, the desire to gain expertise on opinion research and message testing and are excited to be a part of this innovative work that is key to the reproductive rights movement.


Salary:  $80,000- $95,000
