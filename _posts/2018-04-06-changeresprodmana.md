Change Research, a Public Benefit Company
Lead Political Product Manager
Location: Palo Alto, CA
Full time, non exempt, equity + benefits

Change Research is building technology that makes public opinion polling fast, affordable, and accurate for forward-thinking candidates. We are looking for a product lead who will guide our product experience.
In this role, you will help Change Research craft a great product for: 
- candidates and organizations interested in working with Change Research
- existing customers who want to dig into the results and use polling insights to win
- voters who take one of our online polls 

You will be our first product manager, and there will be a lot on your plate!
You’ll be outward-facing and speak to many candidates, campaign managers, and leaders of advocacy organizations about polling and Change Research. 
You’ll work with our internal team -- engineers, survey analysts, marketers -- to make sure everything fits together into a great product experience.
You’ll question how things are done today and find a better way.
You’ll write, you’ll dig into APIs, you’ll run SQL queries to understand our data, and you’ll no doubt sketch up a design or two.
You’ll comfortably go back and forth between working with know-everything engineers and know-everything politicians (even though they both know everything, they know different things!).
Through it all, you’ll listen, think, communicate and execute in a way that considers the company’s and customer’s process holistically. You are obsessed with quality, problem solving and creativity.
We are looking for candidates with product management experience, technical sophistication, and a strong interest in politics.

How to apply:
