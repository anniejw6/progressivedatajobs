Justice Innovation Lab (JIL) provides data-driven, evidence-based analysis to prosecutors to
reduce incarceration and racial disparities and increase fairness in the criminal justice system.
JIL is seeking a senior data scientist and technologist to serve as the Director of Analytics and to
lead the technical and analysis components of JIL’s efforts in data-driven prosecution reform.

The Director of Analytics will be responsible for leading and directing all aspects of JIL’s data
analysis program, including developing a strategic plan for analyzing prosecutorial data,
supervising and managing teams of data scientists and technologists (both internal and external
to the organization), and deriving insights from criminal justice data sets.

Using data from law enforcement partners, JIL will analyze criminal justice data to assess
performance on key criminal justice metrics. Such metrics may include: time-to-disposition;
dismissal rates; racial disparities in pretrial detention, plea bargaining, and sentencing; pretrial
detention rates; revocation rates; diversion completion rates; application of fines and fees; charge
reductions; and sentences of incarceration for nonviolent crimes. The goal of these analyses is
to identify and redress root causes of disparities and unnecessary prosecutions. JIL, in
conjunction with our partners, will work to design data-based technical solutions and policy
changes to address identified problems. Future projects might include incorporating predictive
analytics regarding prosecutorial decision-making.

The Director of Analytics will work closely with the Executive Director to determine the best
strategies for analyzing data and for proposing technical solutions to prosecutors, which may
include creating new data collection systems, designing applications and/or internal or public
facing dashboards, and/or building machine learning interventions to assist prosecutors with
making fairer decisions.
