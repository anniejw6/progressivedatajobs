Indivisible seeks an Associate Director of Data who is eager to play both a key technical and leadership role on a results-oriented data team that delivers critical work for stakeholders across the organization.

This role will lead the data engineering agenda for the organization, working across departments to identify opportunities where data engineering can optimize program and/or provide efficiencies for our work.

As the person responsible for overseeing the departmentâ€™s data warehouse and data engineering, you will build data models, create documentation such as data dictionaries and design, test and implement integrations between systems. You will work closely with the Associate Director of Analytics to define and build the analytics and reporting environment of the warehouse, which can then be synced to automated, user-friendly dashboards.

In addition, this position is responsible for managing and developing a strong team. As one of the most technical people on the team, you can expect to help out your fellow teammates with regard to improving their programming skills and learning the methods and rules that enable the data engineering systems to function well. While the position does not have direct staff, it does manage relationships with various vendors and consultants.

This position is ideal for someone with experience working in a movement space and who understands the needs of a movement and how data engineering can help meet those needs. Knowing SQL is a must for this role. In terms of scripting, while the analytics roles may use R, this role is geared toward someone with strong command of Python. This role will report to the Data and Technology Director.
