The Analyst Institute helps Democratic, progressive, civic engagement, and social justice organizations figure out what really works in their mobilization, electoral, issue-based, and advocacy campaigns by partnering on research that uses rigorous, scientific methods. A core part of our mission is to facilitate the sharing of evidence across those working in the progressive ecosystem: we work with labor unions, environmental groups, racial justice organizers, LGBTQIA rights advocates, candidates running for office, and many more. We believe that collaboration across organizations is needed to improve our tactics, methods, and techniques, and that for the progressive movement to be successful, we must continue to learn from one another and work together.

Job description
The Data Partnerships Associate will support Analyst Institute partners in the strategic use and implementation of data and tools with an eye towards becoming “experiment ready.” They will work with partners to improve data processes and provide regular technical assistance for voter and member turnout, advocacy and list-building campaigns.

This isn’t just a data job, this is a coaching, training, and strategic-thinking job. We want someone to help partners think through all the implications of experiments and data for their programs, interpret findings from past experiments and identify areas for improvement both internally at Analyst Institute and for our partners.

You should be someone who ...
* Wants to advocate for good data practices and make program recommendations backed up by rigorous research.
* Enjoys collaborating with others on a wide array of subject matters, both technical and non-technical in nature.

* Is smart and self-motivated, has good attention to detail, and is committed to our partners’ missions of progressive change.
* Has had exposure to usage of data and common tools in a campaign or progressive advocacy setting.
* Can set and meet deadlines and deliverables.  

Your skills and experience might (but are not required to) include ...
* Working on a political or advocacy campaign, in data and analytics or as an organizer.
* Experience with common progressive tools such as NGPVAN, Action Kit or other similar CRMs as a user or administrator.
* Comfort working with large data sets, such as the voter file and membership lists.
* Ability to successfully manage multiple projects moving on different timelines.
* A flare for crafting and presenting accessible materials and trainings.

* Exposure to coding in SQL, R or Python or similar programs.
