At Democracy Works, we believe voting should fit the way we live. To that end, we build technology for both voters and election administrators that simplifies the process and ensures that no voter should ever have to miss an election.

What we do

TurboVote, our first service, helps voters register, stay registered, and cast a ballot in every election, from municipal to national. TurboVote signed up its six millionth voter in 2018 by building the largest college, nonprofit, and corporate voter engagement coalition in the country, including more than 300 campuses, companies like Starbucks, Univision, Facebook, Google, Snap, and dozens more. 

We also manage the The Voting Information Project, which coordinates with state election offices to publish nationally-standardized information about where and how to vote—data that powers everything from Google’s polling place search to our own text message and email reminders to TurboVote users, and received over 120 million impressions in 2016. Ballot Scout helps election administrators track absentee ballots through the mail, providing transparency in the vote-by-mail process and making it easier to follow up when things go awry. And in 2018, we became the organizational home of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED). 


Where you fit in

Collecting and standardizing information on how voting works—how to register, how to vote, and when and where elections are happening—has been central to Democracy Works’s programs from the very start. At present, the research team consists of one full-time and one part-time employee who keep our users in-the-know about what form to use when registering to vote in Wyoming, to whom a voter would mail an absentee ballot application in Maine, and whether there’s an election taking place in Montgomery, Alabama RIGHT NOW. (There might be, if it’s November 12). They’re supported by two product staff and a team of software developers, who ensure that the research team’s knowledge gets translated into data and is then imported into our systems.

Today we’re collecting more information than ever, and we’re shifting how we do so and collaborating more closely with state election offices. That’s where you come in. As data project manager, you’ll be leading the research team through important transitions, helping to reorient our existing research processes to integrate more closely with our state outreach work, and improving our quality assurance processes to ensure accuracy as the research team grows. In addition to managing the research team, you’ll be working closely with the product team and a new government affairs staffer who can help navigate election officials’ needs and advise on how best to engage with their offices.

You will:
* Set goals and define our research priorities
* Manage a growing team of researchers, providing practical support and professional development
* Where contractors come in, you’ll also be supporting hiring and onboarding those temps, though other research staff may manage their day-to-day work
* Document standard operating procedures and develop project-tracking tools to support and coordinate the team’s work
* Maintain the research calendar and develop new project-tracking tools that allow many internal stakeholders to support and understand research work
* With government affairs, develop new methods to share our election data with states and integrate their feedback
* Propose updates to the data specifications we rely on to define election information for Democracy Works systems so they best reflect real election administration practices, in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders 
* Draft and maintain documentation of the data specification for research staff and non-developer stakeholders
