Alloy is a non-profit building data and technology for the Progressive Movement. 

At Alloy we’re doing our part to help slow the spread of the current Coronavirus pandemic, following guidelines from public health officials to ensure the safety of our employees and the health of everyone we work with. We have instituted a policy that allows our staff to work remotely during this time, even as we continue our important work building better data and technology for progressive organizations. 

As part of our commitment to protecting the right to vote and helping mobilize voters, we are continuing to recruit and hire talented professionals dedicated to the ideals at the heart of the progressive movement. 

All over the progressive community, people have mobilized to build power and protect democracy. We equip them with data and technology tools to help them win. 

Our diverse team of designers, data scientists, engineers, and product managers spend their days understanding the needs of people on the front lines of our movement, assembling data, and building infrastructure that progressive causes and campaigns can depend on, long into the future. Join us!

Technical Project Manager 

Technical Project Managers (TPMs) at Alloy are responsible for providing project planning and execution across a variety of priorities within the company. TPMs are charged with clarifying project objectives, defining the process to achieve those objectives, and executing on that plan. Depending on the project, execution responsibilities may include: subdividing large tasks, managing agile software processes, estimating timelines, and maintaining ticket and task management systems. 

In addition, TPMs must engage all relevant team members, manage stakeholders, and communicate broadly to ensure all relevant parts of the company are aligned and have shared expectations. Given the space within which Alloy operates, Alloy TPMs are expected to be able to work on projects requiring significant knowledge of electoral politics, data science, data engineering, and/or database-heavy products. As with all Alloy staff, TPMs are expected to be strong team members who lead with empathy, communicate profusely, foster a supportive team spirit, and have a bias toward action.

TPMs on the Data Acquisition (DA) Team

TPMs on the DA team fulfil several different roles. Each individual person may do only one of these roles or several, and their role(s) may change over time, depending on the needs of the team. 

Data Acquisition

Acquire all the data required by the company for its products

Work closely with the Partnerships, Legal, Core Product, and New Product Development teams to understand our market and user needs
Research and evaluate types of data available, vendors, and terms
Negotiate and execute acquisition agreements
Make tradeoffs between quality, timeline, cost, and ethical factors
Data Analysis

Perform data processing and analysis tasks as requested to support teams across Alloy. This may include:

Cutting files from raw source data, Alloy databases, and/or customer-provided data
Analyzing data sets to provide answers to questions like: what is our phone number coverage in a particular geography? How many unregistered voters are there in a certain county, and do we have contact information for them?
Integrating multiple data sources and creating application-specific views using tools built by Data Science and Engineering
Quality Assurance + Control

Ensure that Alloy has the highest quality data possible, both in incoming data and in our customer-facing products

Define quality metrics to measure both coverage and accuracy of diverse data sets
Create QA and QC processes on incoming data, customer-facing databases, and internal data processing systems to measure and monitor quality metrics
Coordinate with and support the Data Science and Engineering teams to build the models and tools necessary to measure and monitor quality metrics and perform above processes
Perform these tasks on an ongoing basis to proactively measure and monitor data quality
Identify process, tool, and data improvements to increase the quality of Alloy’s data
Define metrics to measure the overall progress of Alloy’s data acquisition efforts and report on them
Respond to specific data quality problems/questions
Process Management

In all of the above work, DA TPMs are expected to work together to build replicable, predictable frameworks and documentation to ensure the team can operate quickly and efficiently. We are happy to hire great candidates that are strong in some of these skills and ready to learn in others.

 

Inclusive Hiring Practices

Alloy values diverse team composition and an inclusive work environment.  We provide general descriptions of our job requirements to be helpful, but individual roles will vary and we encourage all candidates to apply if they meet a significant number of our requested qualifications.  It is not necessary that your resume check every box, as long as you are willing to learn.

Benefits

Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision care paid for by Alloy. We cover 100% of many health plans for employees and heavily subsidize family plans.
Fully paid parental leave of up to 18 weeks.
20 vacation days each year starting on your first day as an Alloy employee, plus 10 Federal holidays.
A sick time policy for your physical and mental well-being as well as that of your loved ones that doesn't take away from your vacation days.
401k with a 3% employer contribution.
Non-Profit

Alloy is a taxable non-profit technology corporation with offices in Washington, DC and San Francisco, CA. This means that we don’t have shareholders to return profits to -- but we do aim to offer salaries competitive with for-profit companies. You may want to know, however, that we are a DC non-profit, and not a 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 federal non-profit, and are not eligible for the programs those federal non-profit organizations enjoy.

 

Alloy does not accept unsolicited resumes from any source other than directly from a candidate.
