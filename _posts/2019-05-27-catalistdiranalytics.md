This is a big and important role for the future of the progressive movement. As the director of Analytics, you’ll be responsible for helping to shape and managing the execution of an ambitious progressive research agenda. This agenda seeks to take the same methods that have helped to identify the best targets for voter contact programs to bigger problems like how to assemble coalitions for long-term electoral victory or how campaigns should adapt to a fractured and siloed media environment. Because of the depth of Catalist’s data, we’re able to answer questions that no one else can really tackle—we have decades of voter files, mountains of historical election results, tons of survey research, a whole host of other data, and it’s all organized and ready for analysis.

We take this challenge seriously and want to make sure that the next Director of Analytics can help realize these goals. In practical terms, you’ll report into the CEO, and manage a team of 5-8 analysts and scientists. You’ll work closely with the product management, client services, tech, and data teams.
Salary: $125,000 - $135,000
