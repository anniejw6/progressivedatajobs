RepresentUs is the nation’s leading right-left anti-corruption organization. We bring together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to secure crucial victories that are defending our Republic and fixing America’s corrupt political system.

But what it means for you, potential coworker, is that you feel what we feel when you wake up every day: a strong sense of purpose that binds you to the spirit of this nation, and an overwhelming sense that you should do something about it. And you want to work with people who feel the same.

RepresentUs is a carefully curated mix of seasoned political campaigners, policy wonks, advertising experts, designers, and engineers. We’re not a startup, but we’ve got startup DNA: we’re nimble, constantly learning and iterating, and we push ourselves to push the envelope—to ignore “industry standards” and set a new standard.

We’re looking for enthusiastic new minds to help us grow, move faster, and achieve more. We believe our political system should reflect the varied voices of our nation, and so should our team. That’s why we’re an Equal Opportunity Employer; people of color, women, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.

About You
You’re a data person. You’d describe yourself as a problem-solver and detective: you’re someone who loves to get to the bottom of things. You know what questions to ask to lead you in the right direction, and you enjoy answering questions that don’t have an obvious solution. You love nerding out over a spreadsheet, but you’re also able to communicate with people who don’t speak data. You can query the database, look through thousands of rows of dirty data, clean it up, and find the one metric that we need to hear to act on it. You’re critical (you don’t get fooled by vanity metrics), but you’re a realist (you can separate the signal from the noise). When you see a problem, you’re quick to come up with possible solutions. And you’re excited to put your skills to work full-time for the anti-corruption movement, in our San Francisco, CA office.

Salary: $65-$75K.
