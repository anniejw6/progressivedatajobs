Colorado Workers for Innovative and New Solutions (WINS) is the local union of state employees making historic gains to secure quality public services and jobs organizing across Colorado. We are a democratic, member-driven organization representing employees across all state departments and institutions. We strive to improve public services by working with management and stakeholders to address the needs of all Coloradans.

We are looking for a Data Coordinator to assist in the development and implementation of member and organizing database support for various efforts within the union, to ensure that information is accurate, comprehensive, and secure, and that users can receive needed information from the databases.
