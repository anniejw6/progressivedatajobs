Vote Forward is a nonprofit organization that builds tools to encourage average citizens to register and show up to vote. We work to increase the participation of traditionally under-represented groups in the electorate, and to increase civic engagement among the public at large by supporting the volunteers working to engage these voters.

Weâ€™re seeking an experienced full-stack software developer to join our team. This is a full-time, paid position. Vote Forward is a remote organization, so we are accepting applicants from around the country. The Senior Software Developer will report to the Executive Director.

Since 2018, tens of thousands of grassroots volunteers have used the Vote Forward platform to send hand-written letters to more than 1.3 million prospective voters to encourage them to register to vote and turn out for elections. As a Senior Software Developer at Vote Forward, you will enhance and evolve this existing platform and build the additional tools and data infrastructure we need to reach millions more fellow Americans. This is an opportunity to use your technology skills to have an enormous positive impact on American democracy.

Vote Forward is closely affiliated with Swing Left, a grassroots network of 600,000+ volunteers led by professionals from the tech, media, finance, nonprofit and art worlds in collaboration with veteran political organizers and strategists. Vote Forward staff work with Swing Left on many projects of mutual interest.



Salary: Commensurate with experience.
