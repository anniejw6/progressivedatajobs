YouGov Blue is a new unit of YouGov exclusively serving Democratic and progressive clients. We leverage the panels, methodology, and technology infrastructure of YouGov to develop novel capabilities to help progressives succeed at the ballot and in the legislative arena. We are looking for individuals who are passionate about both fighting for Democratic and progressive candidates and causes and about statistics and survey methodology to come join us.

As a data scientist, your responsibilities will include statistical analysis of survey data including nonresponse, weighting, imputation, and matching; the design and execution of modeling and other analyses for internal and external research projects; and contributions to our existing internal codebase for statistical analysis.

Required Skills and Background:
• Knowledge of applied statistics and econometrics is essential
• Expert programmer in R and comfortable in Python or C/C++
• 3+ years of experience performing statistical analyses on large datasets, including survey analysis and building hierarchical and predictive models
• Familiarity with relational databases such as PostgreSQL
• Demonstrated ability to work independently on fast deadlines
• Strong attention to detail and accuracy

Nice to haves:
• Strong knowledge of Census and other geographic data and GIS
• Expertise in big‐data solutions like Hadoop, Spark and/or in computing/data warehousing solutions like AWS/Redshift
• Prior work experience for Democratic campaigns, polling or analytics firms, or other progressive organizations.

Location: Preference for NYC or DC, but will consider remote. 

Compensation: Commensurate with experience and qualifications.

YouGov is the North American unit of YouGov PLC, with operations in the US, UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway, France, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, China, and South East Asia.
