The Democratic National Committee’s Tech team is hiring a Senior Data Analyst on the Optimization team to help us build tools and analyze real-time data to help candidates win elections and to empower progressives across the country. We need someone with a keen eye for identifying opportunities for optimization in an electoral context, from voter targeting/segmentation to experimentation/testing to reporting/data visualization. The Senior Data Analyst will work with the Optimization Lead as part of the larger Data team and is concerned both with 1) the near-term operational efficiency of the DNC, state parties, and candidates and 2) the long-range development of game-changing products for the progressive ecosystem at large.

Who we are

The Tech team is a small, diverse team that provides the technology used by candidates and organizers in all 50 states and all 3,413 counties across the United States to analyze data, organize campaigns, raise money, and get out the vote on election day.

But there’s more to do. So we’re hiring analysts, product managers, engineers, researchers, designers, security experts, IT professionals, and data scientists who can use user-centered design and rapid iteration to develop a rich technology ecosystem for progressives—building tools ourselves as well as partnering with other companies and organizations.
Do you want to …

* Secure the future of our country? Right now a lot is at stake in our country and our team has a huge opportunity to make a real difference.
* Work with amazing people? We’re building a diverse, distributed team, hiring the best people we can wherever they are—alumni from past Presidential campaigns working out of DC and New York, experienced product developers from the SF Bay Area, and more.
* Never stop learning? There are people who know about politics and people who know about technology and a few who have figured out some things about how to combine the two, but we are blazing a lot of new trails and you should be comfortable exploring and learning from everyone you can.
