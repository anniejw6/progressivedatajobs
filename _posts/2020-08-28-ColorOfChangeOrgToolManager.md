Color Of Change is the nation’s largest online racial justice organization. As a national online force driven by over one million members, we help people respond effectively to injustice in the world around us, moving decision-makers in corporations and government to create a more human and less hostile world for Black people in America. We activate our members to take action on crucial issues — from criminal justice to media representations to the social safety net and voter freedom — so that we can build the power necessary to transform the written and unwritten rules of society.

Role Summary & Background

We are undertaking a major expansion of our data, analytics, and engineering capabilities to turbocharge our campaigns for change. The digital organizing work we do at Color of Change has taken on new importance during this pandemic, and we are looking for a new team member to take the lead on our distributed organizing tools and help us drastically scale our work. This person should be able to think big about tools and strategy, but be just as excited to dive into the details and clean up some messy data. 

Responsibilities

Big Picture Thinking:
* Serve as a thought partner for our distributed organizing tools (for peer to peer texting, calling, and relational organizing) to make sure we’re using our tools the best way possible. 
* Partner with the Movement Building team to create recruitment processes, training materials, and onboarding flows that prioritize the volunteer experience of our members. 

System Setup and Troubleshooting:
* Administer tools, including coordinating with other data staff to get lists for voter contact and set up campaigns for texting and calling. 
* Lead on troubleshooting for phonebanks and text-a-thons; work with staff, volunteers, and vendors to fix technical issues. 

Data Hygiene:
* Create processes to standardize data (such as scripts and survey questions) in our systems, train staff on these processes. 
* Monitor systems to make sure standards are being followed. Dive in to clean or upload data when needed.

Qualifications

Candidates should have:
* A strong racial justice analysis with the ability to effectively integrate this analysis in your data work, including identifying moments where racial justice may affect the collection, analysis, and presentation of our data.
* People and communication skills: Ability to present, explain, convince, coach, and troubleshoot with volunteers and staff. 
* Empathy and respect, especially for our volunteers. We lead with Black Joy in all our interactions, and we care deeply about our members’ experience. 
* Experience organizing with digital tools for peer to peer texting and phone banking, bonus points if you’ve administered or trained on these systems before. 
* Basic data skills and a desire to learn: You love a well organized spreadsheet and you understand what clean data looks like and why it’s important. Experience with SQL or other programming languages is helpful but not required for this role. 
* Ownership: this is not a “wait for direction” role, strong candidates will have strong bias to action. We’re ready to go, you should be too. 

Salary: $76,000
