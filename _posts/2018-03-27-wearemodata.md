About No on Prop A
No on Prop A is a broad coalition of Missouri citizens who have joined together in a statewide campaign to place Senate Bill 19, the so-called “Right-to-Work” law, on the statewide ballot and give voters the opportunity to exercise their right to a citizen’s veto by using the referendum process provided by Missouri law.

Our coalition is composed of union and non-union workers and employees, business owners, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, community leaders, faith leaders, parents, grandparents and students. 
In 2017, our coalition members and volunteers circulated referendum petitions in every corner of the state to collect the necessary signatures to qualify for the ballot.  On August 18th, the coalition submitted over 310,000 signatures in an unprecedented effort to far exceed the basic requirements and qualify in all eight Missouri congressional districts.
