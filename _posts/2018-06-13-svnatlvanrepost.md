State Voices is committed to creating a fair and just society by advancing racial equity and working to make our democracy more accessible, inclusive, and representative.

Our network of 20 nonpartisan state coalitions, called “tables,” works with hundreds of grassroots organizations to break down barriers to civic participation and to bring underrepresented and marginalized populations―and their issues―to the center of public discourse. State Voices tables connect these groups to one another and to organizations from different sectors, creating multi-cultural, multi-issue coalitions that can leverage their collective power to transform our democracy.

State Voices fights for our democracy by focusing on civic access, civic engagement, and civic representation. We identify emerging trends in fundamental policy areas (voter registration, voter protection, Get Out the Vote, 2020 U.S. Census and redistricting reform) and share them with our diverse network of partner organizations working on critical issues ranging from reproductive rights to environmental justice. Additionally, through our Tools for All program, we provide participating organizations with access to data and technology to help them engage more effectively with their communities and with one another.
