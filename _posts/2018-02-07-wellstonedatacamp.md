Wellstone Action’s Data and Analytics Camp (DAC) equips progressive leaders with the cutting edge-data and analytics skills necessary to support electoral campaigns and issue based organizing. Our curriculum centers race, class, gender, sexuality, privilege, power and the ways these dynamics shape our lives, tools and campaigns.

A hybrid online and in-person program, DAC kicks off with four days of in-person training and culminates with 4-6 weeks of intensive online learning in the subject of the participants choice. This year, we’re proud to offer the following online courses: Python for Data Engineering, SQL and GIS, VAN Administration or HTML/CSS for CRMs.

We work to accommodate practitioners at various points in their organizing journey and pull from best practices in data, analytics, engineering and organizing to help campaigners and activists build winning online and offline campaigns.
