Type: Full-time  
Location: San Francisco  
Contact: Cori Pryor, cori@hustle.com  
Position Title: Senior Software Engineer, Product  

As a product engineer, you will be working on Hustle's core web and mobile products: our web and mobile text messaging apps, our campaign administrative interface, and our message delivery back end. Product engineering at Hustle is unique in that we do not have mobile, front-end and backend specialists. Instead engineers are empowered to develop and ship features in their entirety covering the whole stack.

This feature of product development is enabled by Hustle's particular technology choices: the use of JavaScript, React, React Native and Node.js through out the stack. It's a stack that heavily rewards generalists that just want to ship things. It also makes for a very adaptable working environment: from a temporary team for a larger project where you choose to focus on shipping a polished mobile frontend and for the next project from another temporary team where you would focus on delivering a humming backend.
