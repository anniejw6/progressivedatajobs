The Center on Rural Innovation (CORI) is a startup action tank and social enterprise that uses progressive public, private, and philanthropic partnerships and strategies to achieve sustainable economic success in small town rural America.
With funding from Reid Hoffman, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund, Walmart, Rural LISC, the Kauffman Foundation, the Siegel Family Endowment, as well as other public figures and foundations, CORI is working to revitalize rural America through on-the-ground programming and investment as well as national research and thought leadership.
Our on-the-ground programming entails launching Innovation Centers in small towns - facilities that offer digital job skills training for the “future of work,” co-working space, distance-work opportunities, support for entrepreneurs, housing for young workers, amenities and cultural resources. Our goal is to develop a replicable and scalable paradigm for rural economic development in America.
Our research and thought leadership focuses on modernizing rural economic development strategies and providing resources to help rural stakeholders across the country make better strategic decisions and investments. A key part of this “rural knowledge hub” is a powerful, open-source, web-based GIS system of datasets and analysis tools that allows technologists and non-technologists alike to form a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in rural America. We intend for this tool to facilitate rural research, strategy, and investment and be useful to everyone from journalists to nonprofits, community leaders to academics and more.
Selectively, we also undertake mission-aligned strategy consulting engagements centered around our geospatial and data analytics capabilities.
CORI is headquartered in a historic general store building in the village of Hartland, Vermont, a part of the Upper Valley and greater Dartmouth College region. 

What You'll Do
As a data analyst, you will serve as a member of the organization’s data analytics and mapping team actively developing CORI’s web GIS technology stack and data streamlining tools. This is a dynamic and wide-ranging role in an organization that is rapidly evolving and building a national profile. We are looking for an analyst who has demonstrated experience wrangling data and building SQL databases. You should have expertise using R and versioning software like Github; any geospatial analytics experience is a plus.
