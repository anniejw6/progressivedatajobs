DSSG seeks fellows, project managers, and data science mentors.
The Data Science for Social Good Fellowship is a full-time summer program to train aspiring data scientists to work on machine learning, data science, and AI projects with social impact in a fair and equitable manner. Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows take on real-world problems in education, health, criminal justice, sustainability, public safety, workforce development, human services, transportation, economic development, international development, and more.

For three months they learn, hone, and apply their data science, analytical, and coding skills, collaborate in a fast-paced atmosphere, and learn from full-time mentors coming from industry and academia.


Location: Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh)
