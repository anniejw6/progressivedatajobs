NDWA Labs is the innovation arm of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, one of the country’s most dynamic and successful social change organizations in the world. Our premier product, Alia, is the first portable benefits platform that enables independent domestic workers to access benefits they need through their work. We are looking for an ambitious Product Lead to spearhead a product and growth strategy for Alia.

The Problem We’re Solving: The way we work is changing. Without a bold plan and new solutions, it won’t end well for most of us. The rise of the gig economy and freelancing is widening the massive hole in our social safety net. More and more people are working independently without the economic scaffolding benefits such as paid sick days or workers compensation provides. We’re harnessing the power of design and technology to finally do something about it for millions of low-wage workers who power our economy. 

Who We Are:  Call us crazy, but we’re building new solutions to fix really, really old problems.  Experimentation is in our DNA. We see value where others don’t and we make visible what’s always been invisible . At our core, we think that if people work, they deserve benefits. We’re obsessed with workers, and we’re the ones to bring every conversation--whether about the future of work, the gig economy on the social safety net--back to what workers need. We love sitting at the uncomfortable intersection of nonprofit / labor organization / tech startup. We’re not afraid to try 5 not-so-great ideas to get to 1 really good one, but we want to interrogate the data and make a call quickly. 

About You: You’re a seasoned product leader who wants to roll up her sleeves to build something great. You are data-obsessed leader who is meticulous about targets and KPIs, but can also assess the long-term through growth and forecasting. You’re constantly asking, ‘ok, what do we need to learn to get there?’ and easily pick up the phone to call users and simply find out. You know how to build teams because you’re empathic, open, and honest in your communication and expectations.You’re fascinated by the way technology intersects with the way we live, with a healthy dose of concern for the direction we’re headed.You are deeply committed to creating more value that we capture. You believe that if people work, they deserve benefits.

The Role: You will lead a dedicated, creative and passionate team to build and scale the first portable benefits platform in the country. We’re in a critical, early stage and we need to make progress methodically but quickly. Key responsibilities include:
